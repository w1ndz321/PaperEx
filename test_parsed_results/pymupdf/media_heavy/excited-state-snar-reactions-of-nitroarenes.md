ABSTRACT: Nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) tradi-
tionally requires ground-state dearomatization to form Meisen-
heimer intermediates, restricting the reactivity to arenes bearing
strong electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs). Here we disclose
excited-state SNAr reactions of nitroarenes under visible light
irradiation, in which triplet-state electronic reorganization furnishes
a strong aromaticity-recovery driving force for CAr−NO2
substitution, enabling reaction pathways that are inaccessible in
the ground state. Following computational evaluation of common
nucleophiles, we developed a synthetically practical protocol that
enables denitrative substitution across diverse polycyclic arenes.
These findings demonstrate that photoexcitation can reshape the aromatic character of arenes, thereby offering a new strategy to
access previously inaccessible modes of arene functionalization.
1. INTRODUCTION
Nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) is a fundamental
transformation in organic synthesis. It is the second most
frequently employed transformation in medicinal chemistry,
occurring at least once in the synthetic pathways of numerous
blockbuster pharmaceuticals.1 It enables regioselective ipso-
substitution to construct C−C2 and C−heteroatom2−5 bonds
on aromatic scaffolds. Mechanistically, both stepwise and
concerted SNAr pathways proceed through the formation of
Meisenheimer intermediates or Meisenheimer-like transition
states,6,7 involving partial dearomatization and substantial
accumulation of negative charge on the aromatic ring.8,9
Consequently, SNAr reactions typically require electron-
deficient arenes bearing strong electron-withdrawing groups
(EWGs) at the ortho- or para-positions of the leaving group to
stabilize the intermediate and offset the energetic penalty of
dearomatization10 (Scheme 1A, left). While transient elec-
tronic activation strategies, such as transition-metal coordina-
tion (e.g., Ru,11,12 Rh,13 Cr14), or alkali7/base-mediated2,15
arene polarization, can facilitate nucleophilic substitution
without EWGs (Scheme 1A, right). These methods often
rely on strongly basic environments or expensive catalysts,
which limit their scalability and functional group tolerance.
Moreover, under such basic conditions, competing elimina-
tion-addition pathways may lead to the formation of aryne
intermediates,16 often resulting in poor regioselectivity and
mixtures of ipso- and ortho-substituted products.17 Thus, the
scope of SNAr remains fundamentally constrained by the
electronic structure of the arene in its ground state. In contrast,
photoexcitation temporarily reshuffles electron density across a
π-conjugated framework, creating a reactive landscape that is
inaccessible thermally, such as photoinduced skeleton

on.23−26
However, the aromatic substitution reaction under the
excited state still remains scarce (Scheme 1B). Only isolated
examples of substitution reactions of nitroaromatics under
excited state have been reported since the 1970s,27,28 yet the
applicable substrates were mostly nitronaphthalene, and
nucleophiles were large access amount of cyanide, boron
hydride, or hydroxide (usually more than 10 equiv).29−32
Because the irradiation source was UV light, the substitution
reaction always occurred both on the CAr-LG (leaving group)
bond and CAr-H bond33 with the formation of a complex
mixture. Herein, we report an excited-state SNAr reaction of
nitroarenes without external electron-withdrawing groups
under visible light irradiation, and can replace the nitro moiety
with various nucleophiles, to construct C−H/C−D/C−O/C-
N/C−C bonds (Scheme 1C). Density functional theory
(DFT) calculations demonstrate that photoexcitation reconfig-
ures the electronic structure of the π-extended nitroarene,
thereby enabling the excited-state SNAr to proceed with the
recovery of aromaticity.
Thermally, the NO2 group behaves as a conventional
electron-withdrawing activator, and not a general leaving
group in arene transformations until 2017, the Nakao group
reported a Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling strategy to construct
C−C and C−N bond by using the nitro moiety as
pseudohalides.34−36 In early 2025, our group reported a
visible-light-promoted denitrative chlorination of unactivated
nitroarenes.37 FeCl3 served as a photosensitizer to generate
chlorine radicals and thereby activated ground-state nitro-
arenes toward radical aromatic substitution (SRAr). During the
reaction condition investigation, we observed ∼5% yield of

denitrative chlorination product even in the absence of iron
catalysts or external oxidants (Scheme 1C, initial result),
indicating that nitroarenes themselves are able to engage with
light under the photoirradiation conditions. The UV−vis
absorption spectrum also confirmed a non-negligible absorp-
tion onset of nitroarenes in about 390 nm (Figures S2 and
S22), indicating the possibility of excitation under light
irradiation. Motivated by our photocatalyst-free aromatic
denitrative chlorination reaction, and recently reported nitro-
arene mediated transformation under excited state,38−43 we
hypothesized that nitroarenes might possess the intrinsic
potential to undergo SNAr reaction from an excited state.
Through a combined computational and experimental
approach, we elucidate the mechanistic origin of this previously
uncharacterized denitrative reactivity and evaluate common
nucleophilic anions to identify substitution-competent nucle-
ophile classes under light irradiation conditions. Guided by
these insights, we developed a broadly applicable denitrative
functionalization protocol for π-extended arenes that proceeds
without the requirement of prior electronic activation. The
synthetically practical and scalable reaction is able to deliver
the products that are readily diversified in downstream
transformations. This work establishes an excited-state
manifold as a mechanistically distinct platform for SNAr
reactivity, enabling rational nucleophile selection and extend-
ing denitrative substitution to structurally diverse polycyclic
arenes.
2. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
2.1. Reaction Mechanism of Denitrative Chlorination:
Excited-State SNAr
Despite the low reactivity of photoinduced denitrative
chlorination of nitroarenes (5% yield, Scheme 1C), its
potential for enabling excited-state substitution reactions
prompted our density functional theory (DFT) mechanistic
investigation to inform the development of more efficient
denitrative substitutions. As demonstrated in Figure 1A, the
denitrative chlorination of ground-state nitrobiphenyl (S0) via
a concerted SNAr mechanism requires overcoming a
prohibitively high activation barrier of 49.3 kcal/mol, which
is related to the dearomatization feature of the transition state
(1TS0). Upon photoexcitation, nitrobiphenyl is promoted to
its singlet excited state (S1, Figure S3), followed by an
intersystem crossing (ISC, Table S2) to afford biradical triplet
species T2. T2 then undergoes internal conversion (IC) to form
the lowest triplet-state species T1, which further forms van der
Waals complex 3IM1 with the chloride. Subsequent concerted
SNAr of 3IM1 occurs with an activation barrier of 28.7 kcal/
mol, which is more favorable than that of ground state SNAr by
20.6 kcal/mol.
The significantly lower barrier of the excited-state SNAr
reaction could be attributed to two major factors. First, the
excited-state SNAr is facilitated by the enhanced electrophilicity
of the ipso-carbon C4 in T1 due to intramolecular charge
transfer44,45 and π-electron density reorganization of the
nitrobiphenyl during the excitation-relaxation process. This is
evidenced by the calculated Dual Descriptor46 Δf(r) for C4 in
T1 (0.047) and S0 (−0.0328), which suggests that C4 changes
from nucleophilic in S0 to electrophilic in T1 (right panel of
Figures 1B and S4). Consistent with its electrophilic property,
NPA charge47 and spin density analysis unveil obvious radical
cation character for C4 in T1 (qC4 = 0.179, ρC4 = 0.304).
Second, the excited-state SNAr is driven by aromaticity
recovery. We performed aromaticity analysis48−52 on the key
structures along the reaction coordinate (Figure S5). Figure 1
presents the bifurcation value (DBV) of the electron
localization function (ELF), an aromaticity scale (aromatic:
DBV > 0.70; nonaromatic: DBV = 0.55−0.70; antiaromatic:
DBV < 0.55) defined in previous studies.52−54 In T1, the
nonsubstituted phenyl ring (Ph1) and nitro-substituted phenyl
ring (Ph2) were identified as nonaromatic (DBV = 0.61,
Figure 1B, left and Table S3) and antiaromatic (DBV = 0.51,
Figure S5),48−52 distinct from S0 involving two aromatic
phenyl rings. In 3IM1, the aromaticity of Ph1 (DBV = 0.64) is
partially recovered via partial charge transfer (Δq = 0.423)
from Cl−to nitrobiphenyl. With further electron transfer from
Cl−in 3TS1, Ph1 becomes aromatic (DBV = 0.73). Finally,
Ph2 becomes aromatic when the nitro group is replaced with
Cl in 3IM3. Overall, the SNAr process of T1 gradually recovers
the aromaticity of the two phenyl rings, differing from the SNAr
of S0. In conclusion, the computational study unveils that the
denitrative chlorination reaction occurs via exited-state SNAr
process, which is facilitated by the enhanced electrophilicity
and driven by aromaticity recovery.55,56
2.2. Computational Identification of Nucleophile
Candidates
Based on the unveiled reaction mechanism, we further seek to
develop more efficient denitrative substitution reactions. As
computational analysis revealed, the excited-state SNAr process
gradually restores the aromaticity of the phenyl rings via
electron donation from the nucleophile; thus, the electron-
transfer capacity of the nucleophiles may influence the reaction
pathway. To test this hypothesis, we first calculated the charge
change of nucleophile in 3IM1 (ΔqNu) for 16 representative
carbon, hydrogen, halogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur
nucleophiles57 (R is the methyl group in relevant nucleo-
philes). The computational results demonstrated that ΔqNu
exhibits high correlations with the oxidation potential (R2 =
0.86, Figure S6) and vertical ionization potential (R2 = 0.80,
Figure S6), indicating that the charge transfer trend is related
to ground state properties of the nucleophiles. As shown in
Figure 2A, I−, Br−, RCOO−, F−, and CN−could transfer partial
charges (ΔqNu < 0.6) to the substrate, similar to Cl−. While,
other nucleophiles could transfer a single electron to T1 (ΔqNu
> 0.7), which may enable the electron-transfer promoted
SNAr,58 a distinct mechanism compared to the two-electron-
transfer process observed for Cl−. To test this possibility, we
analyzed the substitution reaction with RNH−. As depicted in
Figures 2B and S5, the single electron transfer of RNH−to T1
generates
3IM1′ in which Ph1 nearly recovers aromaticity
(DBV = 0.67, Figure S5) and Ph2 partially recovers aromaticity
(DBV = 0.58). The nitrobiphenyl in 3IM1′ may further couple
with RNH• radical to form the σ-complex

and finish the substitution in a stepwise manner (stepwise path
I). This proposed mechanism is supported by the two-
dimensional potential energy surface (PES, Figure 2C) scan,
which identifies two saddle points separated by the σ-complex.
Further DFT optimizations (Figures S7 and S8) confirm that
these saddle points correspond to the transition states (TSs) of
nucleophile addition (3TS1′) and nitro group dissociation
(3TS2′), respectively. On the other hand, the two-dimensional
PES of the denitrative chlorination reaction locates the saddle
point of the concerted pathway. Meanwhile, it identifies two
additional saddle points corresponding to the TSs of nitro
radical dissociation (3TS1) and nucleophile addition (3TS2).
This alternative stepwise path II is calculated to have an
activation barrier (28.3 kcal/mol, Figure S13) comparable to
that of the concerted pathway. Overall, initial computational
assessments suggest that the SNAr reaction may proceed via a
concerted or stepwise mechanism depending on the nature of
nucleophiles.
To further evaluate the relative reactivity of nucleophiles
toward the SNAr reaction of nitrobiphenyl, we examined the
three plausible mechanisms for the reactions of all of the
nucleophiles. It was found that nucleophiles with ΔqNu > 0.7
are able to form a σ-complex with T1, while the concerted TS
and the radical complex 3IM3 cannot be located. Thus, they
are considered to undergo the electron-transfer-promoted
stepwise SNAr reaction, and their relative reactivity was
assessed by the relative stabilities of the σ-complex. These
nucleophiles were classified into two groups (Figure 2C) based
on the formation energy of the σ-complex (ΔGIM3′). H−,59
HO−, RCONH−, RO−, RCOCH2
−, and RNH−60 were
classified into the more reactive group as their ΔGIM3′ values
are relatively smaller (<15.0 kcal/mol). (RCO)2CH−, RS−,
HS−, and RC(CH2)O−were classified into the less reaction
group due to their larger ΔGIM3′ values (>17.0 kcal/mol).
Nucleophiles with ΔqNu < 0.7 were found to undergo
concerted or (and) stepwise SNAr (Figures S10−S15). Their
relative reactivity was assessed using the activation barriers of
their preferred pathway (ΔG‡). F−, CN−, and RCOO−were
calculated to be more reactive than Cl−, while Br−and I−show
comparable reactivity with Cl−. Together, H−, HO−,
RCONH−, RO−, RCOCH2
−, RNH−, F−, CN−, and RCOO−
are potentially more efficient nucleophiles for the excited-state
SNAr reaction of nitrobiphenyl.
2.3. Experimental Evaluation of SNAr Reactions of
Nitrobiphenyls
The experiments began by testing the 9 nucleophilic anions
identified computationally. Upon experimental optimization, 8
nucleophilic patterns successfully afforded the corresponding
substitution products under external-photocatalyst-free con-
ditions (Table 1), which were proved inactive without light. As
suggested by DFT calculations, carboxylic acid should be
compatible for denitrative substitution. However, an oxidative
decarboxylation process can occur with the presence of
nitroarene under light irradiation, thus the denitrative
substitution can be hampered61 (see Figure S19). Further-
more, control experiments confirmed that this reaction could
still proceed without oxone, albeit with diminished yield. We
believe the role of oxone was to suppress the formation of
reduction side products or intermediates of nitroaromatics (see
Figures S26−S28 for details). Radical trapping experiments
indicated that the reaction mechanism did not proceed via a
radical pathway (see Tables S13 and S14 for details).
Starting from these model reactions, this protocol was
further expanded and demonstrated broad applicability across
arenes featuring diverse scaffolds and substitution patterns
(Figure 3). 4-nitro-1,1′-biphenyls bearing electron-withdraw-
ing groups, such as trifluoromethyl or halides at the 4′-para
position, afforded the corresponding hydrogenated products
(2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14) in 63−72% yields. Substrates
containing biphenyl motifs were converted to the correspond-
ing products (16, 18) in 70 and 55% isolated yields,
respectively. The method also tolerated para-phenylethynyl
nitroarenes and 2-nitrothiophenes, affording hydrogenation
products (20, 22) in 72 and 48% yields. Fused ring nitroarenes
engaged effectively as well, providing substitution products
(24, 26, and 28) in approximately 70% yields. The deuterated
analogues (3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, and
29) were obtained in comparable yields to their hydrogenated
counterparts, with a yield difference of less than 10%. Notably,
the deuteration incorporation rates were higher than 95%
across all cases, even in the presence of H2O. Beyond hydride
sources, denitrative etherification was achieved by using a weak
nucleophile (HFIP) to afford biaryl ether products (31).
Substrates bearing heterocyclic rings (32, 33, and 37−39) or
fused ring systems (34−36) afforded the corresponding
etherification products in 45−81% yields, and 2-nitro-
thiophenes participated efficiently to deliver 40 in 75% yield.
Furthermore, monocyclic compounds including pyridine (41),
thiophene (42), benzene ring (43), and benzamide-protected
benzene ring (44) can all undergo the reaction to afford the
corresponding etherification products with 41−60% yield.
Additionally, trifluoroethanol as nucleophile afforded the
product with 75% yield (30). The scope of the protocol was
further expanded to include nitrogen-based nucleophiles for
direct denitrative functionalization. A series of primary amines,
including ethanolamine (45, 46, 49), 2-methoxyethylamine

(47), boc-protected amines (48), isobutylamine (50), and
pivalamine (51), were successful nucleophiles to produce the
corresponding aminoarenes in 28−66% yields, respectively.
Secondary amines failed to give out substitution products but
reduced nitroarene directly to aniline derivatives because of
their relatively stronger reducing ability. Trifluoroacetamides
also proved compatible, delivering C−N bond coupling
products without detectable C−O bonding byproducts (52).
Both electron-deficient nitroarenes (53) and electron-rich
(54−57) underwent denitrative amination, providing the
products in varying yields from 36 to 72%. Most importantly,
for monocyclic systems, acetyl (Ac)-protected nitroanilines
(58), as well as nitropyridines (59), can also afford the target
products. Nonfluorinated substituted alcohols or amides were
unsuccessful substrates because of the need of stronger base to
generate O/N based anion nucleophiles. However, such bases
can likely react with the acidic C−H bond on the ortho
position of the nitro group, thus leading to side reactions.
Finally, the protocol was expanded to other nucleophiles such
as tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (TBAH). Hydroxy- and
fluoro-biphenyl derivatives (60−63) were obtained in 42−74%
yields. The methodology was also applicable to the
polyaromatic ring, affording hydroxylated pyrene (64).
Trifluoromethoxylation (65), fluorination (66), enolization
(67), and cyanation (68−70) were also accomplished, albeit in
lower yield. Dissociated fluoride as well as enolate are
supposed to exist at a relatively lower concentration in the
reaction mixture, leading to lower conversion of denitrative
substitution. Trifluoromethoxide can decompose gradually,62
therefore the yield of the substitution product is low. Those
experiments were then extended to models predicted as less
favorable, such as bromide, iodide, and so on. Most
nucleophiles were unreactive under the standard conditions
(see Figure S19), further supporting the computational model
as an effective predictor of the intrinsic reactivity of
nucleophiles. Furthermore, we carried out the reaction at
120 °C without light irradiation. For nitroarenes bearing one
more electron-withdrawing group (2, 22, 24, 30, 33, 34, 37,
38, 45, 52, 54, 55, 57, 60, 65, and 66), which are prone to
undergo a thermally induced SNAr reaction, most of them
failed to give denitrative products, demonstrating fundamental
mechanistic distinction of our reaction with classical trans-
formations. To further demonstrate the applicability of the
protocol, 3.0 mmol scaled-up reactions were performed on
selected substrates, furnishing hydrogenation, etherification,
amination, and amidation products (24, 35, 37, 46, and 56) in
moderate yields (Figure 4A). Furthermore, the methodology
was successfully integrated with site-selective nitration,
enabling the consecutive modification of molecules (Figure
4B). 34 and 35 were subjected to a well-established nitration
procedure to introduce a nitro group. Subsequent denitrative
etherification and amination afforded the doubly functionalized
products 71 and 72 in 75 and 85% yields, respectively.
4. CONCLUSION
In summary, this work establishes an excited-state SNAr
reaction for nitroarenes. Mechanistic studies revealed that
photoexcitation of nitrobiphenyl induces a redistribution of
electron density that transiently alters the substitution
landscape, enabling nucleophilic attack and rearomatization
without ground-state electronic penalties. Further reactivity
analysis highlights nucleophiles with favorable substitution
characteristics, which were subsequently examined and
developed experimentally. The resulting protocol proceeds
without preinstalled electron-withdrawing groups or external
photocatalysts, accommodates polycyclic arenes, and is
synthetically practical. More broadly, these findings demon-
strate that excited-state electronic reconfiguration can be
leveraged to unlock aromatic substitution pathways inacces-
