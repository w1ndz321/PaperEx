Autonomous scientific discovery with large language model (LLM)-based agents has recently made substantial
progress,demonstratingtheabilitytoautomateend-to-endresearchworkflows. However,existingsystemslargely
relyonruntime-centricexecutionparadigms,repeatedlyreading,summarizing,andreasoningoverlargevolumes
of scientific literature online. This on-the-spot computation strategy incurs high computational cost, suffers
from context window limitations, and often leads to brittle reasoning and hallucination. We propose Idea2Story,
a pre-computation–driven framework for autonomous scientific discovery that shifts literature understanding
from online reasoning to offline knowledge construction. Idea2Story continuously collects peer-reviewed
papers together with their review feedback, extracts core methodological units, composes reusable research
patterns, and organizes them into a structured methodological knowledge graph. At runtime, underspecified
user research intents are aligned to established research paradigms, enabling efficient retrieval and reuse of
high-quality research patterns instead of open-ended generation and trial-and-error. By grounding research
planning and execution in a pre-built knowledge graph, Idea2Story alleviates the context window bottleneck of
LLMs and substantially reduces repeated runtime reasoning over literature. We conduct qualitative analyses
and preliminary empirical studies demonstrating that Idea2Story can generate coherent, methodologically
grounded, and novel research patterns, and can produce several high-quality research demonstrations in
an end-to-end setting. These results suggest that offline knowledge construction provides a practical and
scalable foundation for reliable autonomous scientific discovery. Our codebase is publicly available at

1 Introduction
As research increasingly moves toward fully autonomous scientific discovery, large language model (LLM)-based agents
have attracted growing attention for their ability to automate complex research workflows (Chai et al., 2025; Cornelio
et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2021). Recent systems (Lu et al., 2024; Yamada et al., 2025; Gottweis et al.,
2025) demonstrate that LLM-based agents can autonomously execute an end-to-end research loop, including literature
review, code generation, experiment execution, and manuscript drafting. These results suggest that automated scientific
discoveryisbecomingpracticallyfeasibleandthatLLM-basedagentsareapproachingaleveloffunctionalcompleteness
required for autonomous research (Jin et al., 2024; Sahu et al., 2025; Ajith et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2025b, 2026).
Despite this progress, existing systems remain constrained by a fundamental inefficiency in their execution paradigm,
which limits their scalability and robustness in practice. In particular, most current research agents (Wang et al., 2025b;
Yang et al., 2024; Mitchener et al., 2025; Luo et al., 2025) rely on anon-the-spot computationstrategy, where nearly
all information acquisition, reasoning, and synthesis are performed online at runtime. Under this paradigm, each new
research attempt requires the agent to dynamically retrieve large volumes of scientific literature, read and summarize
long and heterogeneous documents in real time, and explore a broad space of candidate methods and experimental
designs through open-ended generation and trial-and-error. As a result, the cost of producing a single effective scientific
discovery remains substantial. For example, a complete execution of the overall pipeline often requires several hours and,
in some cases, up to 15 hours to progress from ideation to experimentation (Lu et al., 2024). Similarly, in (Schmidgall

et al., 2025b), literature review and experimental planning alone account for a significant portion of total inference time
and place heavy demands on the language model’s ability to maintain coherent reasoning over long contexts. More
importantly, this runtime-centric design repeatedly forces the model to re-process large volumes of unstructured and
partially redundant information, even when much of the underlying scientific knowledge is already well established,
thereby increasing computational overhead and exacerbating the risk of hallucination and reasoning errors (Wang et al.,
2025a; Shin et al., 2025).
To address the efficiency and reliability limitations of existing autonomous research agents, we propose Idea2Story, a
scientific discovery framework that explicitly separates offline knowledge construction from online research generation,
with the goal of reducingrepeated reasoning over scientific literatureand alleviating thecontext window bottleneckof
large language models. Most current systems rely on runtime-centric execution, where agents repeatedly retrieve, read,
summarize, and reason over large collections of highly overlapping papers for each new research attempt, resulting in
substantial computational cost and prolonged execution time. Idea2Story mitigates this inefficiency by shifting literature
understanding from online reasoning to an offline stage. In the offline phase, the system periodically collects recently
accepted, peer-reviewed papers together with their full review feedback, extracts core methodological units and research
patterns, and organizes these units and their observed composition relations into a continuously updated structured
knowledge graph. This knowledge graph serves as a compact and reusable representation of established scientific
methods and their empirical compatibility, replacing repeated processing of raw documents at runtime. Building on
this offline knowledge infrastructure, Idea2Story performs online research generation by aligning underspecified user
research intents with existing research paradigms encoded in the knowledge graph. Rather than relying on open-ended
generation and trial-and-error, the system retrieves high-quality research patterns as structured compositions of method
units, which act as stable methodological blueprints for downstream experimental design and execution. Guided by these
validated research patterns, Idea2Story conducts feasibility-driven experimentation and ultimately generates a complete,
submission-ready paper in an end-to-end manner.
Our work makes the following contributions to autonomous scientific discovery : (1) We introduce Idea2Story, a
framework that formalizes autonomous research as apre-computation–drivenprocess, where scientific knowledge
is extracted, structured, and maintained in a continuously updated methodological knowledge graph, addressing the
2
inefficiency and unreliability of runtime-centric research agents. (2) We propose a knowledge-grounded planning and
execution pipeline that alleviates thecontext window bottleneckand reducesrepeated runtime reasoningover literature
by converting paper reading into retrieval over a pre-built knowledge graph. (3) We conduct preliminary empirical
studies and comparative evaluations, demonstrating that Idea2Story can produce several high-quality research demos
and establishing the practical feasibility of the proposed paradigm in an end-to-end setting.
2 Related Work
2.1 Autonomous Scientific Discovery
Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have driven growing interest in autonomous scientific discovery
agents that aim to automate the full research lifecycle, from code generation to experimental execution (Hu et al., 2026;
Zhang et al., 2025a; Lin et al., 2025). Early systems such asThe AI Scientist(v1) (Lu et al., 2024) demonstrate the
viability of end-to-end automation but rely heavily on manually crafted code templates and largely linear exploration
workflows, which restrict discovery depth and adaptability. Later approaches, includingThe AI Scientist-v2(Yamada
et al., 2025) andKosmos(Mitchener et al., 2025), reduce reliance on explicit template through the incorporation of
agentic tree search and experiment management agents, enabling iterative and multi-round exploration.
In research ideation, LLM-generated ideas are often perceived as highly novel during initial screening; however, prior
studies(Sietal.,2024)uncoveracriticalparadoxwherebysuchideastendtounderperformafterimplementationrelative
to human-generated ideas, indicating limited feasibility and practical utility. As more ideas are generated, LLM outputs
exhibit growing similarity, leading to diminished meaningful diversity. Similar limitations have also been observed in
researchevaluationandpeerreview(Liangetal.,2024;Xuetal.,2025;Thakkaretal.,2025;Zhangetal.,2026). Existing
AI-based reviewers display systematic blind spots: Shin et al. (2025) shows that LLM reviewers place disproportionate
emphasis on technical correctness while undervaluing novelty, deviating from human expert judgment, while Sahu et al.
(2025) demonstrates that AI reviewers struggle to distinguish fine-grained acceptance categories and are susceptible to
sycophancy, with review scores increasing unreasonably after exposure to author rebuttals. Although recent approaches
suchasAgentReview(Jinetal.,2024)seektomitigatethesedeficienciesbysimulatingdiversereviewerroles, automated
evaluation systems remain less reliable than human experts in identifying robust accept/reject decision boundaries.
2.2 LLM-Driven Agents
LLM-driven agents still struggle to interact effectively with complex real-world environments. Despite their strong
generative capabilities, many existing systems—such as OpenHands (Wang et al., 2025b) and SWE-Agent (Yang et al.,
2024)—exhibit limited performance when applied to realistic codebases. These limitations largely stem from insufficient
reasoning over hierarchical dependencies and structural constraints, as well as the inherent restrictions imposed by
finite context windows. As a result, LLM-driven agents achieve relatively low task completion rates on challenging
benchmarks such asMLE-bench(Chan et al., 2024) andSciCode(Tian et al., 2024). RepoMaster (Wang et al., 2025a)
further identifies inadequate modeling of codebase structure, including function call graphs and module dependency
graphs, as a key bottleneck for LLM-driven agents operating in large and complex environments.
Beyond execution limitations, LLM-driven agents also exhibit notable deficiencies in scientific rigor and evaluative
judgment. When tasked with autonomous assessment, these agents are prone to hallucination and overconfidence. For
instance, Agent Laboratory (Schmidgall et al., 2025b) reports that automated evaluations produced by LLM-driven
agents substantially overestimate paper quality compared to human reviewers. Evaluations ofKosmos(Mitchener
et al., 2025) further reveal a tendency to invent opaque quantitative metrics and to conflate statistical significance with
scientific value, leading to weak interpretability of experimental conclusions. Moreover, long-horizon autonomous
execution exacerbates these issues by introducing behavioral drift (Arike et al., 2025), where LLM-driven agents
gradually deviate from intended research trajectories or generate overly strong and insufficiently justified claims (Lu
et al., 2024; Schmidgall et al., 2025a; Baek et al., 2025; Hong et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2023; Lin et al., 2025; Hu et al.,
2026). This drift further undermines reliability and highlights the need for stronger structural grounding and validation
mechanisms in LLM-based autonomous research systems.

3 General Idea Generation
Idea2Story is designed to interact with users through high-level and often informal research ideas that reflect human
intuition rather than fully specified technical plans. The system transforms such underspecified inputs into structured and
academically grounded research directions through a two-stage paradigm that separates offline knowledge construction
from online research generation:
• Offline Knowledge Construction.In the offline stage, Idea2Story builds a reusable methodological foundation
from existing scientific literature. This includes curating a large-scale paper pool from peer-reviewed venues,
extracting reusable method units that capture core methodological contributions, and organizing these units into a
structured knowledge graph that encodes their semantic and compositional relations. The resulting knowledge
graph serves as a persistent repository of methodological abstractions, decoupling literature understanding from
runtime reasoning.
• Online Research Generation.In the online stage, Idea2Story grounds user-provided research ideas through
retrieval and composition over the pre-built knowledge graph. Given an informal user idea, the system aligns the
input with existing research paradigms, retrieves relevant research patterns, and composes compatible method
units into concrete research directions. These instantiated patterns are further refined through a review-guided
process that iteratively evaluates and revises them with respect to novelty, methodological soundness, and
conceptual coherence. The refined research patterns then serve as structured blueprints for subsequent planning,
feasibility-driven experimentation, and end-to-end paper generation.
3.1 Offline Knowledge Construction
The offline knowledge construction stage aims to distill reusable methodological structure from existing scientific
literature and to organize it in a form that can be efficiently accessed during online research generation. Instead of
performing document-level reasoning at runtime, Idea2Story pre-computes a structured representation of prior work that
captures both methodological abstractions and their observed compatibility in accepted research. This stage consists of
three main components: (i) constructing a curated paper pool from peer-reviewed venues, (ii) extracting core method
unitsthatrepresentreusablemethodologicalcontributions,and(iii)organizingtheseunitsandtheircompositionrelations
into a structured knowledge graph. Together, these components form a persistent methodological memory that decouples
literature understanding from downstream idea grounding and research generation.
3.1.1 Paper Pool Construction
We construct a paper pool from accepted machine learning papers and their associated peer reviews collected from
top-tier conferences. LetC={NeurIPS,ICLR} denote the set of venues considered, and letT denote the most recent
three-year time window. The resulting paper pool is defined as
P={𝑝|𝑝is an accepted paper from𝑐∈ CduringT },
which consists of approximately 5,000 papers from NeurIPS and 8,000 papers from ICLR. For each paper𝑝∈ P , we
retain the full textual content
x 𝑝 =(title 𝑝,abstract 𝑝,body 𝑝),
together with its associated review artifacts
r 𝑝 ={comments,ratings,confidence scores,meta-reviews}.
This yields a temporally aligned corpus that jointly captures research contributions and evaluation signals.
To protect privacy, we apply an anonymization functionA (·) that removes all author- and reviewer-identifying
information, including names, affiliations, email addresses, and explicit identity references. In addition, we apply a
safety filtering functionF (·) to review content to remove toxic or abusive language and personal attacks. The final
stored representation of each paper is given by
˜𝑝=F (A (𝑝)),
resulting in a de-identified paper pool
˜P={˜𝑝|𝑝∈ P },
which preserves technical content and review feedback while minimizing exposure to private or harmful information.
4
3.1.2 Method Unit Extraction
Based on the de-identified paper pool ˜P, we define an automated extraction procedure that identifies the core
methodologicalcontributionsofeachpaperinastructuredandreusableform. Formally,wemodelmethodunitextraction
as a mapping
E: ˜𝑝→ U 𝑝 ={𝑢 (1)
𝑝 , . . . , 𝑢(𝐾 𝑝 )
𝑝 },
where˜𝑝∈ ˜Pdenotes a single paper andU𝑝 is a small set of method units that capture its essential technical ideas.
As illustrated in Figure 2, the extraction procedure leverages the standardized structure of academic papers and analyzes
different sections to collect complementary methodological signals. Letx 𝑝 =(intro 𝑝,method 𝑝,exp 𝑝) denote the
partition of a paper into its introduction, method, and experiments sections. The introduction is used to identify
the high-level research motivation and the precise problem formulation, the method section provides signals about
core technical mechanisms such as modeling assumptions, learning objectives, model architectures, and optimization
strategies, and the experiments section reflects how these mechanisms are instantiated and evaluated in practice. By
jointly aggregating information from these sections, the extractor isolates method units that correspond to the primary
algorithmic or modeling contributions of the paper, rather than surface-level experimental details.
We define a method unit𝑢∈ U 𝑝 as a self-contained description of how a research problem is formulated or solved,
abstracted away from specific implementation choices and experimental configurations. Elements that primarily involve
dataset selection, hyperparameter tuning, or engineering-level optimizations are excluded unless they induce substantive
changes to the problem formulation, model structure, or learning objective. In practice, most papers yield one or a small
number of method units. Each extracted unit is further normalized into structured methodological attributes, including
atomic meta-methods, which correspond to indivisible methodological elements, andcomposition-level patterns, which
describe how multiple method units are combined within a single paper.
After extracting method units for all papers, we represent each paper𝑝∈ ˜P by a vector embedding derived from its
associated method units. Formally, let
z 𝑝 =𝑔(U 𝑝),
where U𝑝 denotes the set of extracted method units for paper𝑝 and 𝑔(·) is an embedding function that maps a set of
method units to a fixed-dimensional representation.
To induce higher-level research patterns, we first apply a nonlinear dimensionality reduction operator
y 𝑝 =UMAP(z 𝑝),
which projects the high-dimensional embeddings into a lower-dimensional space while preserving local semantic
neighborhoods. We then perform density-based clustering on the reduced representations using DBSCAN, yielding a
partition
C={𝐶 1, . . . , 𝐶𝑀 },
where each cluster𝐶𝑚 ⊂ ˜Pcorresponds to a coherent research pattern.
These induced clusters serve as higher-level abstractions over individual papers, capturing recurring methodological
structures that are reused across the literature. The resulting research patterns form the basis for subsequent retrieval and
composition.
3.1.3 Knowledge Graph Construction
Building on the extracted method units, we organize reusable methodological components into a structured knowledge
graph that supports systematic method discovery and composition. While individual method units capture isolated
algorithmic or modeling ideas, effective research methods in practice typically arise from structured combinations of
multiple method units. The knowledge graph provides a unified representation that explicitly encodes canonicalized
method units, meta-methods, and their empirically observed composition relations in prior work.
Formally, we define the knowledge graph as a directed graph
G=(V,E),

Figure 2Offline knowledge graph construction in Idea2Story. Academic papers and their associated review artifacts are first
anonymized and safety-filtered, then deconstructed into layered methodological representations. These layers capture complementary
aspects of a paper, including its core research idea, domain context, high-level story skeleton, and packaging actions. The extracted
elements are normalized into atomic method units and meta-methods, which are connected through composition and similarity
relations. Reviewer feedback is incorporated as additional signals to refine relations and validate abstractions.
where each node𝑣∈ V corresponds to a canonicalized method unit or a meta-method. Canonicalization groups
semantically similar method units across the corpus into shared meta-method abstractions, reducing surface-level
variation while preserving core methodological intent. As a result, nodes in the graph represent atomic or minimally
indivisible methodological elements that are reused across papers.
Edges in the graph encode composition relations between method units. For a given paper𝑝∈ ˜P with extracted method
unit setU𝑝, we add directed edges between pairs of method units(𝑢𝑖, 𝑢 𝑗 ) ∈ U 𝑝 × U𝑝 to indicate that they are jointly
instantiatedaspartofthesamemethodologicalpipeline. Theseedgescaptureempiricalevidenceofmethodcompatibility
observed in prior work, reflecting how different method units are combined in practice rather than hypothetical or
manually specified relations.
Aggregating composition relations across the full corpus yields a graph structure that encodes both methodological
abstraction and empirical compatibility. In particular, the graph captures two complementary levels of structure: (i)
reusable methodological elements represented as canonicalized method units and meta-methods, and (ii) composition
constraints induced from co-occurrence statistics in accepted papers. This separation allows Idea2Story to reason about
methods at a higher level of abstraction than individual papers, while remaining grounded in observed research practice.
3.2 Online Research Generation.
Givenatargetresearchobjective,Idea2Storytreatsmethoddiscoveryasagraph-basedretrievalandcompositionproblem
over G. The system retrieves relevant subgraphs and composes compatible method units by following connectivity
constraints in the graph, producing candidate research patterns that correspond to structured combinations of method
units. These research patterns serve as high-level methodological blueprints that bridge abstract research intent and
concrete experimental design, enabling downstream planning, feasibility analysis, and end-to-end paper generation.
3.2.1 Research Pattern Retrieval
Given a user-provided research idea expressed in natural language, we formulate research pattern identification as a
structuredretrievalproblemovertheknowledgegraph G. Let𝑞denotetheinputresearchidea,andlet C={𝐶 1, . . . , 𝐶𝑀 }
denote the set of research patterns induced from the paper corpus. The goal is to rank patterns inC according to their
relevance to𝑞.
6
Rather than relying on a single similarity metric, Idea2Story adopts a multi-view retrieval formulation that aggregates
complementary signals from different semantic abstractions. Formally, for each research pattern𝐶𝑚, we compute a
relevance score
𝑠(𝐶 𝑚 |𝑞)=
∑︁
𝑣∈ V
𝜆𝑣 𝑠𝑣 (𝐶𝑚 |𝑞),
where V={idea,domain,paper} indexes the retrieval views,𝑠𝑣 (·)denotes a view-specific scoring function, and𝜆𝑣 are
fixed weighting coefficients that balance the contribution of different views.
Idea-level retrieval.At the idea level, the system retrieves previously observed research ideas that are semantically
similar to the input query𝑞. Let I denote the set of stored research ideas extracted from the corpus, and letsimidea(𝑞, 𝑖)
denote a semantic similarity function between𝑞 and an idea𝑖∈ I . The idea-level score of a research pattern𝐶𝑚 is
computed by aggregating the similarity scores of ideas associated with the pattern:
𝑠idea (𝐶𝑚 |𝑞)=max
𝑖∈ I (𝐶𝑚 )
simidea (𝑞, 𝑖),
whereI (𝐶 𝑚)denotes the set of ideas linked to pattern𝐶𝑚.
Domain-level retrieval.At the domain level, the system interprets the input idea𝑞 in terms of its underlying research
domains and methodological themes. LetD denote the set of research domains, and letsimdomain(𝑞, 𝑑) measure the
relevance between𝑞and domain𝑑∈ D. The domain-level score of pattern𝐶𝑚 is computed as
𝑠domain (𝐶𝑚 |𝑞)=
∑︁
𝑑∈ D (𝐶𝑚 )
simdomain (𝑞, 𝑑)𝑤(𝑑, 𝐶 𝑚),
whereD (𝐶 𝑚)denotes the domains associated with pattern𝐶𝑚, and𝑤(𝑑, 𝐶 𝑚)captures empirical effectiveness signals
derived from the knowledge graph.
Paper-level retrieval.At the paper level, the system retrieves papers whose technical content is semantically aligned
with the input idea. LetP (𝐶𝑚) denote the set of papers instantiating pattern𝐶𝑚. The paper-level score is computed as
𝑠paper (𝐶𝑚 |𝑞)=max
𝑝∈ P (𝐶𝑚 )
simpaper (𝑞, 𝑝) ·𝛼(𝑝),
where simpaper (𝑞, 𝑝) measures semantic similarity between𝑞 and paper𝑝, and𝛼(𝑝) denotes a quality-related weight
derived from peer review metadata.
The final ranked list of research patterns is obtained by ordering patterns according to their aggregated multi-view
relevance scores. Formally, we define
C∗ (𝑞)=Rank 𝐶𝑚 ∈ C

,
where patterns are sorted in descending order of the aggregated score.
3.2.2 Review-Guided Refinement
After candidate research patterns are retrieved, Idea2Story refines them using an explicit LLM-based review loop. In
each iteration, a large language model is prompted to act as a reviewer and evaluate the current research pattern along
several predefined criteria, including technical soundness, novelty with respect to existing literature, and overall clarity
of the problem–method alignment. The reviewer produces both scalar judgments and concrete revision suggestions.
The system then uses this feedback to update the research pattern in a targeted manner. When the review indicates
insufficient novelty, the system modifies the pattern by recombining compatible method units or introducing alternative
realizations within the same pattern family. When the review identifies issues in feasibility or ambiguity in formulation,
the system revises the problem definition or method structure to improve consistency and executability. Each revised
pattern is re-submitted to the same review process, forming an explicit generate–review–revise loop.

pattern, and higher-level research story.
To prevent uncontrolled drift, only revisions that improve the reviewer scores are retained; otherwise, the system rolls
back to the previous version. This process repeats until the reviewer judges the pattern to be sufficiently novel, coherent,
and technically plausible, or until further iterations no longer yield improvement. The output of this stage is a refined
research pattern that has been iteratively vetted by an LLM-based reviewer and is suitable for downstream validation and
paper generation.
4 Experiments and Analysis
We evaluate Idea2Story through a set of experiments focusing on its ability to extract reusable methodological structure
and to generate high-quality research patterns from ambiguous user input. Our experiments are conducted on a corpus
of accepted papers from ICLR and NeurIPS over the past three years, including approximately 13K papers and their
associated peer reviews, which serves as the foundation for all subsequent analyses. Based on this corpus, we first
analyze the properties of the extracted method units to assess whether Idea2Story captures meaningful and reusable
methodological abstractions. We then present qualitative demonstrations of research patterns instantiated as structured
research stories, illustrating how the system transforms vague research intent into coherent and methodologically
grounded research directions.
4.1 Implementation Details
To further assess the effectiveness of Idea2Story in practical research ideation settings, we conduct additional qualitative
experiments on a small set of representative cases. Specifically, we evaluate three user-provided research ideas curated
by an external collaborator. For each case, Idea2Story generates research patterns using the GLM-4.7 (Zeng et al., 2025)
model as the underlying language backbone. As a baseline, we compare against direct LLM generation, where the same
model is prompted to produce a complete research story without explicit pattern modeling or retrieval.
4.2 Case Study: Method Unit Extraction
We present a representative case study to illustrate the behavior of the proposed method unit extraction agent. Case 1
shows an example extracted from an accepted paper, where the system decomposes the full paper into a structured set of
methodological elements.
As shown in the example, the extracted method unit explicitly separates the underlying research problem, the core
solution pattern, and the resulting research story. TheBase Problemdescribes the core challenge addressed by the paper,
namely understanding how individual training examples influence model behavior during finetuning, without depending
on specific datasets or implementation details. TheSolution Patternsummarizes the central methodological idea as
an analysis framework for step-wise influence accumulation, highlighting the key mechanism without binding it to a
particular optimization setup or experimental configuration. Importantly, the extractedStoryreframes the technical
8
contribution at a higher level of abstraction, connecting learning dynamics to broader phenomena such as hallucination
and alignment in large language models. This abstraction reflects how the method unit goes beyond algorithmic details
to capture the conceptual contribution of the paper. Finally, theApplicationfield grounds the method unit by indicating
downstream research and system-level implications, without enumerating task-specific benchmarks.
This example demonstrates that the extraction agent isolates reusable methodological structure while filtering out
implementation-leveldetails. Byrepresentingthepaperasacoherentmethodunitratherthanacollectionofexperimental
components, Idea2Story enables subsequent reuse, comparison, and composition of methodological ideas across papers.
4.3 Knowledge Graph Analysis
We analyze the structure of the constructed knowledge
graph to understand how extracted method units are dis-
tributedacrosspapersandresearchdomains. Asillustrated
inFigure2,thegraphexhibitsaclearhub-and-spokestruc-
ture, where a small number of high-frequency domains
connect to a large number of papers and research pat-
terns. This reflects the uneven distribution of research
activity across domains, while also highlighting domains
that function as central hubs for methodological reuse.
Importantly, many research patterns are observed to con-
nect multiple domains simultaneously, indicating that
the extracted method units often capture methodologi-
cal abstractions that generalize beyond a single applica-
tion area. In contrast, paper-level nodes are typically
associated with a single domain, whereas pattern-level
nodes frequently act as bridges between otherwise weakly
connected domains. This structural separation suggests
that the knowledge graph encodes two distinct levels of
organization—instance-level

research artifacts and reusable methodological abstractions—enabling Idea2Story to retrieve and compose research
patterns at a higher level of abstraction rather than relying on domain-specific or paper-specific similarity alone.
4.4 Qualitative Comparison of Generated Research Patterns
We further compare the quality of research patterns generated by Idea2Story and a direct LLM baseline. Both systems
startfromthesameunderspecifieduserinputandproducestructuredresearchproposals,enablingacontrolledcomparison
of how different generation mechanisms transform vague research intent into concrete research patterns.
Table 1 presents a side-by-side comparison of representative outputs along multiple dimensions, including problem
formulation, methodological structure, and innovation claims. Rather than evaluating surface-level writing quality,
the comparison focuses on the resulting research patterns as methodological blueprints—i.e., how the generated ideas
frame the research problem, identify gaps in prior work, and organize methodological components into a coherent
approach. As shown in the table, Idea2Story tends to induce higher-level problem reformulation, transforming intent
understanding from a fixed classification task into a dynamic structural reasoning process. The resulting research pattern
emphasizes generative refinement, structural priors, and evolving representations. In contrast, the direct LLM baseline
largelyoperateswithinaconventionaltaskformulation, proposingastrongersystemthroughtheintegrationofadditional
components such as context modeling and hierarchical objectives.
To reduce evaluation bias, the generated research stories from both approaches are subsequently assessed by an
independent large language model (Gemini 3 Pro) (Team et al., 2025), which is not involved in either generation process.
The evaluator is instructed to compare the outputs in terms of novelty, methodological substance, and overall research
quality, without access to the generation method used. Across all evaluated cases, the externally evaluated results
consistently favor the outputs generated by Idea2Story. In particular, the research stories produced by direct LLM
generation tend to remain at a high level of abstraction, with less concrete methodological grounding and reliance on

EcoIntent: A Context-Aware Multi-Granularity
Agent for E-commerce Intent Understanding via Hi-

Abstract Focus Reinterprets intent classification as a structural evo-
lution process rather than static text classification.
The approach leverages a diffusion-based framework
to iteratively refine noisy query representations into
precise intent labels, integrates product graph embed-
dings to ground predictions in e-commerce context,
and introduces a discrete, context-aware tokenizer to
handle long-tail domain vocabulary.
Targets improved intent classification performance
by integrating heterogeneous behavioral context and
hierarchical product knowledge. A dual-stream archi-
tecture aligns semantic representations with user in-
teractionhistory,andhierarchicalcontrastivelearning
enforces consistency across fine- and coarse-grained
intent categories.
Problem Definition Reframese-commerceintentclassificationfromstatic
text prediction to dynamic structural reasoning. User
queries are short, ambiguous, and heavily dependent
on implicit catalog structure, which fixed-label clas-
sification fails to capture. Intent understanding is
modeled as an evolving process under structural con-
straints.
Formulates intent understanding as a conventional
multi-class classification problem, where the input
is a query augmented with session context and the
output is an intent label from a predefined set. The
main challenge is semantic sparsity caused by short
and ambiguous queries.
Core Research Gap Existing intent classification methods treat queries in
isolation and ignore domain-specific structural priors
in e-commerce. They fail to exploit rich relation-
ships between products and attributes, and standard
vocabularies struggle with long-tail, domain-specific
terminology. No prior work unifies diffusion-based
refinement with structural graph embeddings for in-
tent disambiguation.
Prior work suffers from (1) context isolation, where
behavioral signals such as clicks are underutilized,
and (2) a flat-label assumption that ignores the hier-
archical nature of e-commerce taxonomies, leading
to inconsistent predictions for fine-grained, long-tail
intents.
Method Skeleton A diffusion-based classifier that iteratively denoises
intent representations; a context-aware discrete tok-
enizer based on a VQ-VAE variant to encode diverse
e-commerce queries; and integration of pretrained
product graph embeddings as structural priors during
the denoising process.
A dual-stream discriminative architecture consisting
of a BERT-based text encoder, a lightweight GNN

different generation mechanisms transform the same vague research intent into concrete research patterns.
relatively standard techniques. In contrast, Idea2Story-generated research patterns exhibit clearer problem framing, more
specific methodological structures, and stronger signals of novelty.
5 Future Work
While Idea2Story focuses on grounding vague research intent into structured and high-quality research patterns, an
important direction for future work is to extend this framework toward a fully closed-loop research generation pipeline.
A promising extension is the integration of experiment-driven agents that can instantiate, validate, and iteratively refine
generated research patterns through empirical feedback, including automated experimental design, dataset selection, and

preliminary execution. Experimental outcomes can then serve as additional signals to refine the instantiated research
stories, forming a feedback loop between method design and empirical validation. Beyond experimentation, future work
may further explore how refined research patterns can be systematically translated into complete paper drafts, covering
method descriptions, experimental results, and discussion sections. By grounding paper generation in empirically
validated research patterns, such a system could move beyond surface-level text generation and provide more faithful,
end-to-end support for executable and publishable scientific discovery.
6 Conclusion
We presented Idea2Story, a pre-computation–driven framework for autonomous scientific discovery that shifts literature
understanding from runtime reasoning to offline knowledge structuring. By explicitly extracting reusable method units
and organizing them into a continuously updated knowledge graph, Idea2Story enables research agents to reason over
stable research patterns rather than repeatedly processing raw papers. Our qualitative analyses and comparative studies
show that this design leads to research patterns with clearer problem reformulation, stronger methodological structure,
and higher conceptual novelty than direct LLM generation. These results highlight the importance of explicit pattern
modeling as a foundation for scalable and reliable autonomous research. Looking ahead, integrating Idea2Story with
