Abstract

Large language models (LLMs) need knowledge updates to meet the ever-growing
world facts and correct the hallucinated responses, facilitating the methods of
lifelong model editing. Where the updated knowledge resides in memories is
a fundamental question for model editing. In this paper, we find that editing
either long-term memory (direct model parameters) or working memory (non-
parametric knowledge of neural network activations/representations by retrieval)
will result in an impossible triangle—reliability, generalization, and locality can not
be realized together in the lifelong editing settings. For long-term memory, directly
editing the parameters will cause conflicts with irrelevant pretrained knowledge or
previous edits (poor reliability and locality). For working memory, retrieval-based
activations can hardly make the model understand the edits and generalize (poor
generalization). Therefore, we propose WISE to bridge the gap between memories.
In WISE, we design a dual parametric memory scheme, which consists of the
main memory for the pretrained knowledge and a side memory for the edited
knowledge. We only edit the knowledge in the side memory and train a router to
decide which memory to go through when given a query. For continual editing,
we devise a knowledge-sharding mechanism where different sets of edits reside in
distinct subspaces of parameters and are subsequently merged into a shared memory
without conflicts. Extensive experiments show that WISE can outperform previous
model editing methods and overcome the impossible triangle under lifelong model
editing of question answering, hallucination, and out-of-distribution settings across
trending LLM architectures, e.g., GPT, LLaMA, and Mistral‡.

Introduction

Large language models (LLMs) show emergent intelligence when scaling the number of parameters
and data [1–4], which reveals the sparks of artificial general intelligence [5]. However, when
deployed, LLMs still make mistakes [6], generating responses with hallucinations [7], bias [8], and
factual decays [9]. On the other hand, the world’s knowledge is ever-growing, so the up-to-date
knowledge is usually different from the one during LLMs’ pretraining [10]. Many such errors and
emerging facts will arise sequentially in deployment, some of which have to be addressed timely and
efficiently without waiting for retraining or finetuning [11, 12]. Also, retraining or finetuning is often
too computationally expensive [13, 10], which is not sustainable for lifelong growing knowledge.
Therefore, lifelong model editing [10] was proposed to remedy the continual knowledge updates and
injections for LLMs in a cheap and timely manner.

An effective lifelong model editing approach should satisfy the following properties [14, 15, 11, 16,
17]: i) reliability, the model can remember both current and previous edits after sequential editing;
ii) locality, model editing will not influence inherent pretrained knowledge which is irrelevant to the
edited knowledge; iii) generalization, the model is not just merely memorizing the query-target pairs;
instead, it should understand and generalize when given
other forms of queries with the same knowledge. We com-
pare existing model editing and continual learning meth-
ods on the three metrics in Figure 1 and find that it seems to
be an impossible triangle—reliability, generalization, and
locality can not be realized at the same time in the contin-
ual editing settings. We find that where the updated knowl-
edge resides in memories affects editing performances, and
previous methods can be generally divided into editing
either long-term memory, e.g., ROME [18], MEMIT [19],
and FT-EWC (Finetuning with Elastic Weight Consolida-
tion [20], a continual learning method), or working mem-
ory, e.g., GRACE [10]. Note that the categorization of
long-term and working memories is derived from human
recognition [21, 22] and neuroscience [23] which has re-
cently been adopted in the study of LLMs [24–27]. Model
editing of long-term memory refers to directly editing the
model parameters, which contain generalizable parametric
knowledge [28, 24]. However, editing long-term memory
will cause conflicts with previous pretrained knowledge,
resulting in poor locality (e.g., ROME and FT-EWC in
Figure 1). Working memory refers to the non-parametric
knowledge of neural network activations/representations by retrieval, and it does not change the
network parameters [24]; instead, it replaces the representations by retrieval at working (inference)
time, like GRACE. GRACE’s working memory shows promising results in reliability and locality, but
in our experiments, it shows poor generalization since retrieval-based representations can hardly make
the model understand the edits and generalize to different queries. It reveals that long-term memory
and working memory both have drawbacks for lifelong model editing, though there were some special
memory designs for LLM architectures, like MemorryLLM [28], SPALM [27], and Memoria [25],
they change the architectures and cannot be directly applied for different LLMs. Intuitively, there
is a gap between editing working and long-term memories, thus, in this paper, we study:

liability, generalization, and locality.

ods based on long-term memory (ROME
and FT-EWC) and working memory
(DEFER and GRACE) show the impos-
sible triangle in metrics, while our WISE
is leading in all three metrics.

What is the better memory mechanism for lifelong model editing to break the impossible triangle?

Human brains contain the left and right hemispheres, which have different divisions as studied in
recognition science [29, 30], e.g., the left brain is typically associated with logical tasks while the
right brain is more involved in intuitive processes. This inspires us to design WISE, which makes
model editor WISER in memories. WISE contains a dual parametric memory mechanism for LLMs’
editing: the main memory for the pretrained knowledge and a side memory for the edited knowledge,
realizing both long-term memory’s generalization and retrieval-based working memory’s reliability
and locality. The side memory is a form of mid-term memory. We only edit the knowledge in the side
memory and train a router to decide which memory to go through when given a query. For continual
editing, we design a knowledge-sharding mechanism where different sets of edits reside in distinct
and orthogonal subspaces of parameters. These are then merged into a common side memory without
conflicts. Our contributions are as follows:

• We identify the pitfalls of current model editing methods in lifelong settings, that is, the impossible
triangle among—reliability, generalization, and locality. Behind the impossible triangle, we find
there is a gap between editing long-term memory and working memory.

• We propose WISE, with a side parametric memory as the mid-term memory, realizing the ad-
vantages of both parametric long-term memory and retrieval-based working memory. We design
memory routing, sharding, and merging modules in WISE, making WISE lead in continual knowl-
edge editing, reaching the three metrics better simultaneously.

• Extensive experiments on GPT, LLaMA, and Mistral across QA, Hallucination, and out-of-

distribution datasets validate the effectiveness of WISE for lifelong model editing.

2.1 Preliminaries: Lifelong Model Editing

We focus on lifelong model editing problem [10, 11], which can ensure hundreds or even thousands
of sequential edits on LLMs to make the outputs of target queries align with human expectations
while maintaining LLMs’ previous knowledge and capability. Let fΘ : X (cid:55)→ Y, parameterized
by Θ, denote a model function mapping an input x to the prediction fΘ(x). The initial model
before editing is Θ0, which is trained on a large corpus Dtrain. When the LLM makes mistakes or
requires injections of new knowledge, it needs model editing with a time-evolving editing dataset as
Dedit = {(Xe, Ye)|(x1, y1), ..., (xT , yT )}. At the time step T , a model editor (ME) takes the T -th
edit and the LLM of the T − 1 time step fΘT −1 as inputs and produce the revised LLM model fΘT
following the equation below:

fΘT = ME(fΘT −1, xT , yT ),

s.t. fΘT (x) =

(cid:26)ye

fΘ0 (x)

if x ∈ Xe,
if x /∈ Xe.

(1)

Equation 1 describes that after model editing, the LLM should make the correct prediction on
the current edit as fΘT (xT ) = yT , while also preserving knowledge from past editing instances
(x<T , y<T ) ∈ Dedit as well as maintaining capability of fΘ0 on the irrelevant data when x /∈ Xe,
especially for general training corpus Dtrain.

In Table 1, we compare current model editing methods in terms of memory types and lifelong
editing abilities. FT-EWC [20], ROME [18], MEMIT [19], and MEND [31] edit the long-term
memory stored in the LLMs’ model parameters, but they either do not support continual editing or
have negative effects on irrelevant knowledge (poor locality). GRACE [10] is designed for lifelong
editing via retrieval-based working memory. The retrieval codebook can avoid the conflicts of
irrelevant knowledge, but GRACE fails to generalize due to its codebook being a non-parametric
knowledge representation that solely memorizes queries without comprehension. It is worth noting
that SERAC [32]/DEFER [10] uses working memory that is stored in additional small models: a
scope classifier and a counterfactual model, whose knowledge is parametric. However, the small
counterfactual model cannot match the expressiveness and generalization capabilities of LLM itself,
making it challenging for the edited knowledge to generalize effectively.
To enable effective lifelong model editing, the method should take advantage of both LLM parameters’
long-term memory and retrieval-based working memory. Therefore, we propose WISE as follows.

2.3 WISE: Side Memory with Knowledge Sharding, Merging, and Routing

As illustrated in Figure 2, WISE comprises two key components: 1) Side Memory Design: i) side
memory: side memory is a memory container that is initialized as a copy of LLM’s certain FFN layer,
storing the stream of edits; ii) memory routing mechanism: similar to retrieval, a routing activation
component is adopted to identify the scope of edits, routing the main (original) or side memories
during inference; 2) Knowledge Sharding and Merging: i) knowledge in random memory subspaces:
to make the edits in appropriate knowledge density and avoid forgetting, we shard the side memory
into several random subspaces for editing; ii) knowledge merging: we leverage model merging
techniques to merge different memory shards into one side memory without loss of knowledge.

Figure 2: Overview of WISE. Side memory (in blue) and main memory (in green) store edited and
pretrained knowledge, respectively. Note: during inference, if WISE-Retrieve, the activation routing
will retrieve and select one side memory with maximal activation score.

2.3.1 Side Memory Design

Side memory in FFN’s value matrix. Each layer in a Transformer contains a multi-head
self-attention (MHA) mechanism and a feed-forward network (FFN), where the FFN constitutes
two-thirds of the model parameters [33]. The question of how Transformers retrieve and utilize stored
knowledge remains unresolved [18, 34], yet past works [31, 33] have demonstrated that editing the
weights of the FFN is consistently more effective for LLMs. The FFN typically consists of key-value
linear matrices: Wk, Wv, i.e., two multi-layer perceptron (MLP) layers. For the output of attention
feature f , the computation of the feed-forward network, omitting the bias terms, can be represented as:

FFN(f ) = a · Wv = σ(f ⊤ · Wk) · Wv,

(2)

where σ is a nonlinear activation function (e.g. SwiGLU, GeLU), and a represents the activation
values of the first MLP layer. Following previous works [18, 33], we edit the value matrix Wv of
the chosen FFN layer.
However, directly editing the value matrix may cause forgetting and side effects in a lifelong setting.
Thus, we copy a value matrix as side memory and edit the side memory instead of the original
matrix (main memory). Specifically, the side memory is initialized with the copy of main memory
as Wv′ ← Wv. Given the side memory, the new output is expressed as FFNs(f ) = a · Wv′. We
will introduce how to update the side memory in Section 2.3.2.

Locating side memory’s FFN layer. Transformer LLMs have been widely demonstrated to encode
“lower-level” information (e.g., parts of speech) in earlier layers while processing more advanced
linguistic phenomena like anaphora and coreference in later layers [35–37]. Representations in later
hidden layers propagate through residual connections without drastic changes [38, 18], enabling
effective early exit in LLMs [39, 40]. Therefore, to minimize the side effects of editing and adjust
advanced linguistic phenomena, we target mid-to-late layers (e.g. 27) for side memory. Further
analysis of layer selection is provided in Section 3.3.

Routing between side memories and main memory. Similar to the retrieval-based methods [10,
32], during inference, it is needed to decide whether the main memory or the side memory is used. If a
given query is within the scope of previous edits, the side memory is used; otherwise, the main memory.
Inspired by [11], we introduce a routing activation indicator, given an input x, it is formulated:

∆act(x) = ∥A(x) · (Wv′ − Wv)∥2,

(3)

where A(·) = a is the activation of the side memory’s corresponding FFN layer in Equation 2. We
want the activation indicators of editing queries to be larger than the ones of irrelevant queries by
a large margin, which is:

min{∆act(xe)|xe ∈ Dedit} ≫ max{∆act(xi)|xi ∈ Dirr},

(4)

where Dirr is the irrelevant dataset which includes Dtrain.

similar to contrastive [41] or triplet loss [42]. The margin-based loss function for routing activation is:

La = min
Wv′

{max(0, ∆act(xi) − α) + max(0, β−∆act(xe)) + max(0, γ − (∆act(xe) − ∆act(xi)))},

(5)

s.t. xe ∈ Dedit, xi ∈ Dirr.

Equation 5 aims that for all queries of irrelevant examples xi, the activation indicators should be
less than threshold α, and for the edit samples xe, the activations should be larger than threshold
β, with a certain distance γ between ∆act(xe) and ∆act(xi).
In the continual stream of incoming edits, the smallest activation indicator within the edits is updated
and saved: ϵ = min{∆act(xe)|xe ∈ Dedit}. We aim to recognize the local scope of edits in this form.
During inference, if the activation indicator of a new input is greater than ϵ, WISE will use the side
memory Wv′; otherwise, using the main memory Wv. Thus, given the query x, the output of the
targeted FFN in Equation 2 is replaced by:

FFNout(x) =

(cid:26)A(x) · Wv′
A(x) · Wv

if ∥A(x) · (Wv′ − Wv)∥2 > ϵ,
otherwise.

2.3.2 Knowledge Sharding and Merging

How to effectively and efficiently store continual knowledge in model parameters is important for
lifelong editing. We introduce the notion of “knowledge density” (similar to knowledge capacity [43])
that describes how many pieces of knowledge are stored per parameter on average. There is an editing
dilemma w.r.t. knowledge density: i) If only a few edits are made for full fine-tuning or editing the
entire memory, the knowledge density is low, which may lead to overfitting. ii) If numerous edits
are made within a common and limited parameter space, the knowledge density is high, resulting in
conflicts within the edited knowledge and potentially causing catastrophic forgetting. To remedy this
dilemma, we propose a knowledge sharding and merging mechanism to divide the edits into several
shards, store them in different parameter subspaces, and merge them into a common side memory.

Wi

v′ ← Wi

Knowledge in random memory subspaces. We edit the side memory Wv′. We divide n edits into
k shards, copy the side memory for k times, and generate k random gradient mask with mask ratio ρ
for each copy of side memory. A random gradient mask Mi ∈ {0, 1}|Wv′ |, i ∈ [k] is a binary mask
whose proportion of 1 is ρ [44]. For edit shard i, i ∈ [k], we edit the knowledge into the subspace
Mi as follows:

v′ − η(Mi ⊙ gi(Wi
(7)
where Wi
v′ is the i-th copy of the side memory, η is the learning rate, gi(·) is the gradient of the i-th
shard of edits, and the gradient is the autoregressive loss plus the routing activation loss La(Equation
5): Ledit = − log PWv′ (ye|xe) + La.
The random mask of gradients freezes the parameters intact when the elements are 0 and updates
the weights when the elements are 1. It is superior to pruning because it does not harm the network
performance while regularizing optimization in a subspace [44]. In addition, the ρ subspace will have
higher knowledge density when k · ρ < 1, resulting in higher generalization (e.g., Figure 5). Also,
different shards of edits have different random masks, and due to the (sub)orthogonality of random
masks, different shards will not conflict with each other. Therefore, we can non-destructively merge
the k copies of side memory into one.

v′)),

Knowledge merging. We merge the k subspace pieces of side memory into one. Because we
randomly generate the subspace masks, different random masks will have some overlapping elements
and some disjoint elements, following the theorem below:

Theorem 2.1 Subspace Overlap. Generate k memory subspaces Wi
v′, i ∈ [k] by random mask with
1’s ratio ρ, so each memory has ρ · |Wv′| active trained parameters. For any two subspaces Wi
v′
and Wj
v′ i ̸= j; i, j ∈ [k], there are ρ2 · |Wv′| active parameters that are overlapped. For all k
subspaces, there are ρk · |Wv′| overlapped active parameters.

The theorem shows that larger ρ will cause more overlap of subspace parameters, and the proof is
in Appendix C. We find that this overlap is helpful in playing the role of “anchors” for knowledge
merging (See Figure 5 and Appendix B.5). However, knowledge conflicts also exist in the overlapped
parameters, so we leverage the recent task arithmetic model merging technique Ties-Merge [45] to

relieve the conflicts. First, we compute the edit weight shift vectors Te = {τ i
Then, we use Ties-Merge to merge the edit vectors into one:

e = Wi

v′ − Wv|i ∈ [k]}.

Wv′ ← Wv + Ties(Te; Wv).
(8)
Ties-Merge consists of three steps: i) trim: trim the redundant parameters for each task vector; ii)
elect the sign: elect the signs of each parameter; ii) disjoint merge: compute the disjoint mean for
each parameter which has the same and correct signs [45]. By Ties-Merge, different subspaces of
knowledge are integrated into one with fewer conflicts. We study the effects of different merging
techniques in Table 11 of Appendix B.2.

Routing and retrieving among several side memories. One single side memory has its limited
knowledge capacity [43]. For the lifelong editing stream, we can produce several side memories
and retrieve them via activation score routing. We compute different activation indicator scores of
side memories and retrieve the top-1 during inference. This design is named WISE-Retrieve, which
enables a more challenging lifelong editing scenario. For WISE with only one side memory, it is
notated as WISE-Merge. For most of the experiments, we use WISE-Merge by default, and we
compare WISE-Retrieve in Table 6 and Figure 6.
The pseudo-code of our method can be found in Algorithms 1 and 2.

3.1 Experimental Settings and Evaluation Metrics
In the experiments, we compare the performance of different baselines and WISE in sequentially
editing LLM models hundreds to thousands of times. In practice, we augment xe by generating
10 random token sequences of length 10 using fΘ, enhancing editing generalization/adaptation to
diverse contexts. We ensure that this augmentation with random tokens is applied across all baselines
(See Appendix B.6, we ablate the contribution of Random Token).

SETTING

Datasets and Models. We choose trending au-
toregressive LLM models LLaMA-2-7B [13],
Mistral-7B [52], and GPT-J-6B [53, 54] for
evaluation. The dataset details are in Table
3. Following [10], we evaluate WISE on the
closed-book question-answering (QA) dataset
ZsRE [46], and also evaluate its ability to cor-
rect Hallucination in SelfCheckGPT [48]. The
Temporal dataset [50] is employed to test the out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization of editing.
Since Temporal comprises emerging entities post-2019, we avoid using the latest LLMs in OOD
experiments. Instead, we follow the original literature of the Temporal dataset [50] and adopt GPT-J-
6B as the base model, which is pretrained on the Pile [51] with a cutoff in 2020. Implementation
details and editing examples for each dataset and can be found in Appendix A.

Baselines. The baselines include methods of continual learning and model editing. We compare
WISE against direct fine-tuning FT-L with an additional KL divergence loss [18], and continual
learning fine-tuning based on Elastic Weight Consolidation (FT-EWC) [20]. We also compare
WISE to other model editors, including 1) GPT-style editors based on causal tracing: ROME [18],
MEMIT [19], and MEMIT-MASS (a batch-editing version of MEMIT); 2) hypernetwork-based
editors: MEND [31]; and 3) the latest memory-based editors: DEFER (inspired by SERAC [32] for
inference routing) and GRACE [10]. Details on all comparisons are found in Appendix A.2.

Metrics. Each edit example includes an edit descriptor (i.e., query) xe, its paraphrase prompts xe′
(if available) for testing generalization, and an unrelated statement xloc for testing locality. For the
editing dataset Dedit = {(Xe, Ye)} with T edits, we evaluate the final post-edit model fΘT after the
T -th edit example (xT , yT ). We evaluate the model editor’s reliability and generalization using the
metrics Rel. (a.k.a Edit Success Rate [10]) and Gen. (Generalization Success Rate [55]), while Loc.
(Localization Success Rate [55]), defined as the post-edit model should not change the output of the
irrelevant examples xloc, assesses specificity. We report these metrics and their mean scores, which
are formally defined as:

Rel. =

where 1(·) is the indicator function. Notably, for the Hallucination dataset, following [10], we use
the perplexity (PPL) to verify the locality, and there is no proper metric for generalization.

3.2 Main Results

Table 5: OOD results for Temporal
dataset. GPT-J-6B is used.

Competitive Performance of WISE. The competitive performance of WISE is evident in Table
2 and 4, which compare its results with eight baselines on the QA (ZsRE) and Hallucination
(SelfCheckGPT) settings. In general, we observe the followings: ❶ WISE outperforms existing
methods on multiple tasks after long editing sequences; ❷ direct editing of long-term memory
(ROME, MEMIT, etc.) creates conflicts with prior pretraining knowledge, resulting in poor locality;
and ❸ retrieving working memory and modifying activations (GRACE, DEFER, etc) struggle to
generalize to diverse queries.
In the QA setting, with T = 1000, WISE achieves average
scores of 0.83 and 0.79 on LLaMA and Mistral, respec-
tively, reflecting improvements of 18% and 11% over the
nearest competitor. This demonstrates WISE’s outstand-
ing stability and effective management of long-sequential
edits. While methods like MEND and ROME are compet-
itive early in editing, they show clear shortcomings as the
edit sequence extends. Directly editing long-term memory
(e.g., MEMIT, FT-EWC, MEND) results in a significant
decline in Loc. When T ∈ {100, 1000}, this indicates that these methods cannot preserve LLMs’
knowledge structure and significantly impair the model’s generalization ability. GRACE excels in Loc.
and Rel. (close to 1.00), however, it sacrifices generalization in continual editing. A possible reason
is that token representation may not be suitable for measuring semantic similarity in autoregressive
LMs, leading to paraphrase xe′ failing to achieve similarity matching with any CodeBook Key in
GRACE (detailed in Appendix B.1). Overemphasis on preserving and precisely adapting training
data (working memory) hampers adaptability to new contexts. In a nutshell, most previous methods
struggle to balance Rel., Gen., and Loc., particularly in long-form editing tasks. In addition, the
results of GPT-J-6B can be found in Figure 9 in the Appendix.
WISE also surpasses the baselines on the Hallucination dataset, maintaining the lowest perplexity
scores of 3.12 and 5.21 at T = 600, with Loc.
remaining above 0.93. We similarly observe

significant PPL increases for FT-L, MEND, and ROME in long-context editing tasks, while GRACE’s
performance is lackluster in LLM long texts (possibly due to the limited fitting capacity of the very
small active trained parameters |hl| of GRACE).

Out-of-Distribution Evaluation.
Ideally, model editing needs to generalize distributionally from
formulaic editing examples to natural texts [50], where the distributional shift involves complexity
rather than conventional domain shift [56]. Following [50], we evaluate the OOD generalization
of editing methods on emerging entities using the temporal updating dataset, Temporal. Editing
examples and evaluation metrics are provided in Appendix A.1. As shown in Table 5, WISE
effectively handles out-of-distribution generalization tasks (achieving the best OOD Gen. and overall
performance). DEFER delivers mediocre performance on OOD Gen. due to the limited capacity of the
auxiliary model[14]. During the fine-tuning phase, GRACE and MEMIT focus on the representation
v∗ of a single input token after Wv (GRACE: last token, MEMIT: last subject token). However,
regarding v∗ the editing carrier encounters two problems: 1) the training objective is not aligned with
the pretraining phase, and 2) the single representation limits the search scope of gradient descent,
making it difficult to handle OOD generalization. WISE, on the other hand, avoids these challenges.

3.3 Further Analysis

Visualization of WISE’s Routing Activation. To
demonstrate the effectiveness of memory routing, we
record the activation values ∆act(x) of 1000 (QA,
ZsRE)/600 (Halluc.) queries during the inference stage via
knowledge merging into a single side memory. As shown
in Figure 3, the purple horizontal line represents the activa-
tion threshold ϵ recorded during the editing phase. Almost
all unrelated queries show low activations with values less
than 10 in ZsRE and less than 20 in Halluc.; meanwhile,
WISE accurately routes the editing prompt and unseen
paraphrases into the side memory. This ensures editing
locality and prevents excessive shifts from the pre-training
distribution during lifelong editing.

routing module of WISE when vary-
ing T . X-axis: Num edits. LLaMA-7B.

Localization Analysis of WISE’s Side Memory. To
validate the benefits of editing mid-to-late layers, we
select decoder layers from early, intermediate, mid-to-late, and late stages. As shown in Figure
4, the ablation results reveal that editing critical layers like the early and final layers (0, 1, 31) is
ineffective, even resulting in a very low Loc. value of 0.096, which indicates a failure to recognize
the editing scope. This may occur because the early layers represent fundamental grammatical
information, and the final layer directly controls the decoding procedure, leading to poor editing
of advanced language functions. Editing in the intermediate layers is suboptimal but still shows
a markable improvement compared to early layers, possibly because intermediate layers start to
integrate basic grammatical information with more complex semantic data. Notably, the mid-to-late
layers demonstrate exceptional editing performance; for instance, selecting layer 26 results in an
80% success rate and generalization while maintaining 100% locality. This empirically supports
our claim in Section 2.3.1 that the redundant mid-to-late layers [39] are ideal side memory layers
and confirms the hierarchical nature of information processing in Transformer LLMs [57, 58].

ratio ρ and the number of subspaces k in Figure 5. On the left figure, for k = 2, the best ρ is 0.2,

knowledge density will cause better generalization. When scaling k, we observe an increasing
demand of ρ. From Theorem 2.1, the probability of subspace overlap is ρk, and we hypothesize that
this overlap is important as an anchor for model merging. Interestingly, from the right figure, it can
be observed that the optimal cases always have the ρk closest to 0.03. This shows an inherent tradeoff
between merge anchor and merge conflicts, and the subspace overlaps around 0.03 are optimal for
the best performances. Such experiments indicate that 20% FFN parameters can accommodate
at least 500 edited samples. When "mask memory exhaustion" occurs, we can allocate new mask
parameters to store new knowledge. Using retrieve when knowledge isn’t full and merging as needed
to save memory, achieves true lifelong model editing.

strongest baselines including MEMIT-MASS and GRACE. WISE-Retrieve based on top-1 activa-
tion retrieval demonstrates the best results in 3K edits, showing the effectiveness of well-organized
memory subspaces and routing strategies during editing. We note that the “oracle” exhibits marginal
performance decline when scaling the edits from 2K to 3K, yet it demonstrates remarkable perfor-
mance across all metrics. This underscores the potential of WISE to handle extremely long continual
edits, contingent upon substantial improvement in the retrieval of side memories. Additionally, an
appropriate replay of edits can further improve retrieval accuracy, as detailed in Appendix B.3.

Contribution of Router designs in WISE. Without the
router strategy, all inputs either pass solely through the main or
side memory. To further validate its effectiveness, we conduct
additional ablations with La. WISE’s performance on ZsRE
is shown in Table 7. We observe the expected decrease in Loc.
w.o. La, such as dropping from 1.00 to 0.72 at T=1000, re-
veals the router’s effectiveness in identifying editing scopes,
minimizing side effects, and retaining a substantial amount of pre-training knowledge.

Inference Time Analysis of WISE. Figure 6
shows the inference time of a single instance for
LLaMA after t ∈ [0, 3000] editing steps, measured
across 10 trials of each setting. Consistent with our
expectations, we find that WISE-Merge incurs a con-
stant inference delay (about 3%) as the editing stream
expands. WISE-Retrieve, due to the introduction of
retrieval routing, shows an increase in inference time
as the number of edits increases, with a time cost
increment of about 7% after 3K edits. Knowledge
merging ensures that WISE-Merge only brings constant additional costs (0.64% extra parameters and
4% extra GPU VRAM, as detailed in Appendix B.7), contrasting with past memory-based works that
continuously demand more available memory [10, 32].

Memory and Knowledge Injection of LLMs. LLMs have long-term (episodic) and working mem-
ory [24, 25, 27]. Long-term memory is stored in model parameters, updatable via (re)pretraining [53],
finetuning [59], and model editing [14]. Working memory resides in neuron activations, utilized
during inference [24]. In-context learning and retrieval-based editing methods like GRACE contribute
to working memory [60, 10]. However, whether finetuning or retrieval is debated [61, 62]. Also,
current knowledge injection methods often suffer from computational overhead [13, 10], catastrophic
forgetting [63], and overfitting [64]. Methods like MemorryLLM [28], SPALM [27], NKB [65],
and Memoria [25] are proposed to improve the memories from the architecture design perspective.

meta-learning, and retrieval-based methods. ROME identifies factual associations and edits efficiently
using MLP-based memories [18], extended by MEMIT for mass-editing [19]. T-Patcher adds neurons
for edits in LLMs’ feed-forward layers [11]. Meta-learning methods like MEND decouple finetuning
gradients to generalize edits [31], complemented by MALMEN addressing cancellation effects [15].
Retrieval-based methods like SERAC and GRACE improve working memory for editing [32, 10].
From single to mass editing and static to lifelong editing, model editing evolves to meet realistic
demands. The latest efforts in lifelong editing such as LTE [66], MALMEN [15], and RECIPE [67]
require extensive training with domain-specific edits before specific editing, yet we cannot predict
the domain of upcoming edits in the editing flow and accessing these data is often impractical or
unrealistic. It potentially increases the risks associated with retraining.

Model Merging Model merging [68], also known as model fusion [69, 70], studies how to aggregate
different models’ knowledge into one by parameter merging. However, in the research of linear
mode connectivity, it is found that different minima of neural networks can hardly be merged into a
generalized one even if trained on the same datasets from the same initialization (but with different
random seeds) [71, 72]. The main reason is considered to be the permutation invariance property of
deep neural networks, which means that the positions of neurons can be permuted without affecting
the network function [71]; as a result, different minima reside in different loss basins [72]. To improve
linear mode connectivity and model merging, methods like optimal transport [70, 73], re-basin [72],
and training-time alignment [44] are developed. For the applications, model merging techniques can
help to improve the generalization of federated learning [74, 75] and enable knowledge aggregation
of different-task models in a task arithmetic way [76, 77]. Recently, methods like task arithmetic in
tangent space [77], TIES-Merging [45], ZipIt! [78], and ColD fusion [79] have been proposed for
deep model fusion of pretrained foundation models, such as CLIP, ViT, and large language models.
Specifically, TIES-Merging [45] consists of trim, elect sign & merge pipeline, which inspires the
merge process of side memories in our paper.
For detailed related works, please refer to Appendix D.

5 Limitations and Broader Impacts

Although WISE shows promising results in lifelong editing, it also has some limitations. One
limitation is addressed in Table 6 that the side memory retrieval has room for improvement to reach
the oracle. Also, in Figure 6, the inference time of WISE-Retrieve increases with ever-growing
editing streams. However, the current limitations cannot outweigh the merits of WISE in that it
currently reaches better performance in general for lifelong model editing. We bridge the gap between
long-term and working memory, it may inspire further work on memory design for model editing or
even LLM architecture. However, the application of such technologies should be guided by ethical
considerations. Malicious users may attempt to edit LLMs to propagate hate, highlighting the need
for safeguards to prevent abuse and mitigate harmful outcomes. Some current model editors update
the model’s weights directly, making edits hard to trace and withdraw. WISE uses a modular and
non-destructive side memory, allowing users to discard it if edits are unnecessary or harmful, without
modifications to the main LLMs.

6 Conclusion

In this paper, we point out the impossible triangle of current lifelong modeling editing approaches
that reliability, generalization, and locality can hardly be achieved simultaneously. We find the
reason behind this is the gap between working and long-term memory. Therefore, we propose WISE,
consisting of side memory and model merging, to remedy the gap.

Heinz Christian Pander (1794 - 1865) was a German
anatomist and embryologist who was born in Riga, Latvia.
He studied medicine at the University of Dorpat and later
at the University of Berlin. In 1820, he took part in a
scientific expedition to Bokhara as a naturalist.

ZsRE The ZsRE question-answering task [46] is extensively studied within the model editing
literature [18, 19, 31, 15, 11], where each record contains an editing statement xe, a paraphrase
prompt x′
e, and a locality prompt xloc. We use the same train/test split as [31] (163196/19086).
Notably, only MEND requires fitting a hypernetwork on the training set; other methods discard the
training set and perform edits and evaluations on the test set. In practice, we randomly sample 1K
and 3K records from the test set to form the edit sets in Section 3.2 and 3.3.

Hallucination We utilize the same dataset as GRACE,
SelfCheckGPT [48], to assess the ability of Model Editors
to mitigate hallucinations in autoregressive LMs. This set-
ting involves editing highly inaccurate sentences (sourced
from GPT-3 [80]) and replacing them with correspond-
ing sentences from actual Wikipedia entries. This dataset
aligns more closely with real-world deployment scenar-
ios where models trigger "unexpected behaviors," and the
token length of edits is significantly longer than in past
datasets, making it a more challenging editing setting. Un-
like GRACE, which used GPT2-XL (1.5B) [81], our main
experiments deploy larger LLMs, LLaMA and Mistral,

both with 7B parameters, we measure retention of pretraining data (xloc) from the base model: Red-
Pajama [49], a public version of LLaMA’s pretraining data. Some of the exceptionally long editing
samples cannot even be accommodated on an NVIDIA A800 (80GB) due to resource limitations.
As shown in Figure 7, the original dataset provided by GRACE, after tokenization with LLAMATO-
KENIZER, has length distributions ranging from [17,390]. The dimension of a single MLP layer in

xe, ye Self-driving cars, also known as autonomous vehicles, are vehicles that are capable
of navigating and operating without human intervention. These innovative vehicles
rely on a combination of advanced sensors, artificial intelligence, and computer
algorithms to interpret their environment and make real-time decisions. With the
potential to significantly impact numerous industries and sectors, self-driving cars
have the ability to revolutionize transportation by enhancing safety, improving traffic
flow, and increasing energy efficiency. However, challenges related to regulatory
frameworks, ethical considerations, and public acceptance still need to be addressed
before widespread adoption becomes a reality.

xe, yood Self-driving cars, also known as autonomous cars or driverless cars, are vehicles
capable of traveling without human input. These cars utilize a range of sensors,
including optical and thermographic cameras, radar, lidar, ultrasound/sonar, GPS,
odometry, and inertial measurement units, to perceive their surroundings. By
interpreting sensory information, control systems in the car are able to create a
three-dimensional model of its environment. Using this model, the car can then
identify the best navigation path and develop strategies for managing traffic controls
and obstacles. As self-driving car technology continues to advance, it is expected to
have a significant impact on various fields such as the automotive industry, health,
welfare, urban planning, traffic, insurance, and the labor market. The regulation of
autonomous vehicles is also becoming an increasingly important topic of discussion.

full precision and the Adam optimizer would require (390+4+4+4) * (11008 * 4096 * 4) + 4 * 7B =
100.36GB of VRAM (for activations, gradients, first-order, and second-order optimizers), exceeding
the memory capacity of the NVIDIA A800. Consequently, we excluded excessively long samples
(limiting tokenized lengths to 254) and ultimately retained 906 editing instances (compared to 1392
in GRACE). To facilitate a fair comparison with MEND, we specifically allocated a training set for
MEND, with a final train/test split of 306/600. All methods were edited and evaluated on the test set.

[50] sources the prefix xe from the first paragraph of an entity’s Wikipedia page and
Temporal
samples a paragraph ye discussed by GPT-4 [82] about the emerging entity xe, which is usually noisy
but may contain helpful information. These are presented as editing prompts to Model Editors. For
out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization to complex natural contexts (not fitted), yood is taken from
the actual Wikipedia suffix of xe. This setup is utilized to evaluate the OOD generalization of Model
Editors centered around a single canonical example. Consistent with previous work [10], the out-of-
scope data xloc is derived from the Pile [51], the pretraining corpus of GPT-J-6B. Examples from the
dataset can be seen in Table 9. To measure the OOD generalization of editing methods for emerging
entities, we perform model editing using standardized simple examples and then evaluate this behavior
on more complex instances. Following [50], in a natural setting, no single correct continuation exists.
Thus, we also use probability threshold-based evaluations, such as 80%, where the editing success rate
evaluates whether the loss Lxe,yood for an example falls below δ = −log(0.8), as indicated in the for-
mula below. The intuition behind this is that many other plausible alternative continuations may exist.

A.2 Descriptions of Compared Model Editors

FT-L. All other layers of the LLMs remain frozen, and only a single MLP layer is fine-tuned through
autoregressive loss [18]. Additionally, we impose an L∞ norm constraint to prevent the parameters
from deviating too far from the pretrained distribution.
FT-EWC. Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) has been demonstrated to mitigate catastrophic
forgetting by updating weights using a Fisher information matrix, which is computed from past edits,

20

multiplied by a scaling factor λ [20]. Following [10], we omit the constraints of the L∞ norm in this
implementation.
MEND. MEND [31] transforms the gradients obtained from standard fine-tuning using a hyper-
network that converts gradients decomposed into low rank (rank=1) into new gradients, which are
then applied to the target layer for parameter updates. During the training phase, a small auxiliary
hypernetwork receives editing examples (xe, ye), and xloc. MEND’s training loss comprises the
standard autoregressive loss combined with the KL divergence loss of the model’s output on xloc
before and after editing. This hypernetwork plays a crucial role during the editing procedure.
ROME. ROME [18] uses causal analysis to pinpoint knowledge within specific MLP layers
and modifies the entire matrix through least squares approximation. It operates under the strong
assumption that the MLP is the primary module for storing knowledge [33], and it injects a single
piece of knowledge into the MLP at each iteration using a Lagrangian remainder.
MEMIT. Similarly, based on the assumption that the FFN serves as a knowledge key-value store,
MEMIT [19] manipulates parameters of specific layers directly through least squares approximation.
Unlike ROME, which updates a single layer, MEMIT is a multi-layer updating algorithm that
supports simultaneous updates of hundreds or thousands of facts. For sequential model editing
tasks, MEMIT requires immediate on-the-fly repairs when the model makes errors, expressed as
fΘT = MEMIT(fΘT −1 , xT , yT ), involving multiple operations on the original model.
MEMIT-MASS. Unlike sequential editing, MEMIT supports modification of multiple knowledge
fragments in a batch mode, named MEMIT-MASS. Suppose we collect streaming errors as (X , Y) =
{(x0, y0), (x1, y1), ..., (xT , yT )} and inject them collectively into the MLP, it only involves a single
editing operation on the original model as fΘT = MEMIT(fΘ0 , X , Y). Although this approach
loses the capability for on-the-fly repairs, we still include this baseline in our experiments.
DEFER.
In GRACE, a reimplementation of SERAC [32] is utilized, denoted as DEFER. For
new inputs, DEFER includes a network g (corresponding to the scope classifier in SERAC) that
predicts whether to: 1) trust the prediction of the LLMs, or 2) trust the prediction of the new model.
Here, the new model is configured as a single-layer linear network o with a sigmoid activation
function, corresponding to the counterfactual model in SERAC. During the editing process, g and o
are fine-tuned jointly.
GRACE. GRACE [10] utilizes a discrete KEY-VALUE codebook and maintains the codebook
throughout the editing flow by adding, expanding, and splitting KEYs. During the inference phase, it
retrieves the nearest KEY and determines whether to replace the activation of the hidden layer output.

A.3 Training Details and Hyperparameters

Except for MEMIT-MASS, the batch size for all methods is consistently 1 in sequential editing
scenarios. All experiments are conducted using 3 NVIDIA A800 GPUs, with all tasks reproducible
on a single A800. Editing ZsRE takes approximately 4 hours, while Hallucination requires around 6
hours. To ensure fair comparisons, unless otherwise specified (for some methods like MEND, ROME,
and MEMIT, we follow the original literature by selecting the last few layers or using causal analysis
to identify the target layers), the default target layers for editing on LLaMA, Mistral, and GPT-J are
model.layers[27].mlp.down_proj.weight, model.layers[27].mlp.down_proj.weight,
and transformer.h[21].mlp.c_fc, respectively.
For FT-L, we utilize a reimplementation from ROME ¶, employing the Adam [83] optimizer with
consideration of learning rates at 1e-5, 1e-4, and 5e-4, and conducting gradient descents for 50
iterations, ultimately reporting the best results at a learning rate of 5e-4.
For FT-EWC, we follow the reimplementation in GRACE and its default settings, setting the learning
rate at 1e-2, the λewc penalty factor at 0.1, and the number of replay instances at 10.
For the training phase of MEND, we adhere to the original paper, setting the learning rate at 1e-4,
iterating 100K times, and employing early stopping at 30K, ultimately achieving an accuracy of 0.95
on the training set. Notably, we target the last few MLP layers as per the original literature, such
as model.layers[i].mlp.down_proj.weight, model.layers[i].mlp.gate_proj.weight,
model.layers[i].mlp.up_proj.weight in LLaMA, where i ∈ [29, 30, 31].
For ROME and MEMIT, we follow the original literature on GPT-J using the default configurations,
specifically the fifth layer and layers [3,4,5,6,7,8]. In LLaMA and Mistral, additional causal analysis
is conducted to pinpoint the layers storing knowledge. As shown in Figure 8, an increasing trend in

during editing and merging.

the Average Indirect Effect of the MLP is observed across layers [4,5,6,7,8], suggesting that the model
recalls factual knowledge here and passes the matured token distribution via residual connections to
the last MLP. Thus, in LLaMA and Mistral, ROME edits the fifth layer, while MEMIT edits layers
[4,5,6,7,8].
For DEFER, the original literature uses a learning rate of 1.0;
however, we found it unfit for LLaMA and Mistral, with severe
fluctuations in model loss. Therefore, we experiment with
learning rates of 7e-5, 7e-4, and 1e-3, and ultimately report
using 7e-5 (optimal).
For GRACE, we strictly follow the original literature, setting
the learning rate at 1.0, and using replace_last to only re-
place the activation of the last token in autoregressive scenarios.
After observing failures in generalization, we adjust various
ϵinit values and discuss this more in Appendix B.1.
For WISE, the hyperparameters for the QA and Hallucination
tasks are identical. We find that a learning rate of 1.0 with
the SGD [84] optimizer is a good approach for stable train-
ing. The hyperparameters designed in the knowledge editing
phase include the random masking probability ρ and the routing
threshold guidance α, β, γ. In the knowledge merging phase, hyperparameters include the number of
merges k and the merging weights λ for each MLP (we discuss the impact of ρ and k in Section 3.3).
Theoretically, as the importance of knowledge in any MLP is considerable, we always average with
λ = 1/k across all experiments. These are shown in Table 10.

B.1 On the Pitfall of GRACE: Generalization Collapses in Decoder-only LLMs

Here, we discuss why GRACE exhibits poor generalization when editing decoder-only LMs.
As shown in Figure 10, we continuously edit 15 samples (xe, ye) using GRACE and observe the
nearest codebook Key for their paraphrases xe′ and unrelated queries xloc, as well as the governed
Deferral radii ϵ of those Keys. When overlapping Keys exist, GRACE reduces the Deferral radii to
split this Keys and then adds a new codebook entry, resulting in exponentially decaying of radii ϵ
during the editing process. Though ϵ is initialized from a high ϵinit, it will be small and ineffective
after continuous edits. From Figure 10, we observe that GRACE is more likely to have a conservative

strategy that sets smaller Deferral radii during editing. Smaller Deferral radii will cause xe′ to fail
to hit the codebook (the distance to the nearest Key is farther than its Deferral radii) but let xloc
successfully far away from the radii, resulting low generalization and high locality. Also, we observe
that the Deferral radii method is not effective under any ϵinit; for all tested ϵinit values of 1.0, 3.0, 10.0,
and 500.0, they all have low generalization and high locality.
This suggests that in autoregressive LMs, the distribution of the last token cannot effectively represent
semantics; whereas in encoder-only and encoder-decoder architectures, capturing semantic infor-
mation through vector representation has been extensively studied [85–87]. This is consistent with
the degree of generalization shown by GRACE when anchoring the T5 [88] Encoder layer. Some
related works [89] also indicate that in autoregressive models, semantic similarity measures based
on averages of output tokens underperform, recommending the use of score distributions over text
continuations to represent semantic distances.

conflicts occur (hit the codebook Key but with different Edit Target ye), the deferral radius ϵ decays
exponentially. This results in GRACE being unable to encompass the paraphrase xe′ and maintain
high locality, regardless of how ϵinit is adjusted. ZsRE, LLaMA-2-7B.

Here, we conduct a more in-depth study of the knowledge merging
strategies for WISE, exploring various merging approaches including
(i) Linear, which uses a simple weighted average; (ii) Slerp, which
spherically interpolates the parameters of two models; (iii) Ties, a
component used in the main experiments of this paper that resolves
merging disturbances through TRIM ELECT SIGN; (iv) Dare:
which follows a Bernoulli distribution to delete redundant parame-
ters and rescale the remaining ones; (v) Dare_Ties, which combines
dare and the sign consensus algorithm of TIES; and (vi) Sign, an
ablation component of Ties that addresses directional conflicts—all
utilizing the official implementation from MergeKit [68] ||. We randomly sample 100 edits from

decline in editing performance, underscoring the importance of addressing knowledge conflicts in
overlapping parameters. The success of Sign also reaffirms this point. Meanwhile, the randomly
masked knowledge shards exhibit a non-redundancy, indivisible nature. This is demonstrated by
the significantly weaker performance of Dare_Ties compared to Ties/Sign, indicating that removing
parameter updates can lead to the loss of edited knowledge or even potential "anchors".

retrieval accuracy, i.e., whether the Top-1 Activation routes to the correct MLP (prec@1). X-axis:
Num edits. ZsRE. LlaMA-2-7B.

WISE-Retrieve retains each knowledge-sharding memory and retrieves through Top-1 Activation.
However, as shown in Table 6 and Figure 11b, the retrieval accuracy still has significant room for
improvement; specifically, when T reaches 3K, the accuracy of routing to the correct MLP drops to
around 60%, indicating the specificity between side memories is insufficient. One possible reason is
that when sampling the edits from a single dataset (ZsRE), the editing instances (xe, ye) all belong
to the same domain. This leads to some very similar instances being captured by multiple expert side
memories (resulting in high activations for all side memories), introducing more retrieval failures.
Therefore, to improve the specificity of side memory and reduce the probability of routing errors,
we attempt to add a new constraint Lmemo to Equation 5. For knowledge-sharding memory Wi, we
randomly replay instances (xm, ym) from the edit set DWj of past shard Wj, j∈[0,i−1], ensuring that
Wi remains inactive for xm:

As shown in Figure 11b, this replay behavior increases the specificity between side memories, main-
taining nearly 88% retrieval accuracy at T = 3K. Figure 11a also shows that WISE-Retrieve w.
Lmemo improves Edit Success (ES.) by 8.39% compared to WISE-Retrieve, providing a promising
direction for future work. With finer-grained activation management, we might be able to bridge the
performance gap between Retrieve and Oracle.

B.4 Case Study

In Table 12, we present bad cases of using WISE to edit the LLaMA-2-7B on the ZsRE dataset and
mitigating these failures is critical for future work in model editing. We observe that in i) errors occur
only in part of the tokens, and these errors constitute a large proportion of the bad cases, indicating
that the edits have not been sufficiently fitted. ii) displays cases where the entire output is incorrect,
and factual failures indicate difficulties in retaining memory of parameters for some rare entities
(such as Persian iia, iib). iv) presents cases of generalization failure, for example in ivd), where
the model answered “English” but did not fully follow the ground truth, indicating significant room
for improvement in the accuracy of generalized edits. Meanwhile, in iii) we surprisingly find that
even when WISE errs on the Edit Prompt, it can correctly answer its paraphrase iiib) “The kind

Here, we discuss the effects of independent (ensured by
non-overlapping masks) vs partially overlapping param-
eters within MLP subspaces on editing performance, as
shown in Table 13. It is observable that, despite vary-
ing mask ratios ρ and the number of subspaces k, partial
overlap (w. KA) consistently outperforms independent
configurations (w.o. KA) in terms of Reliability (Rel.)
and Generalization (Gen.). For example, at ρ/k of 5/0.20,
there is a relative improvement of 9% and 7% respectively.
This demonstrates that the overlapping regions contribute as “anchors” for knowledge fusion, facilitat-
ing information transfer across different subspaces. Moreover, the shared parameters provide a natural
regularization [90] mechanism, helping synchronize model behavior across different subspaces.

knowledge to cope with various contexts. That is, for a single xe, it expands into (prefixi, xe). The
prefix is derived from tokens that are randomly generated by the original LM fΘ, serving as an
economical data augmentation method. We observe that the editing success rate is compromised
(Figure 12). Specifically, for instance, at T=1000, Rel. and Gen. decreased by 0.15 and 0.17,
respectively. By utilizing randomly generated prefix tokens, the model is able to learn a broader range
of linguistic features, thereby exhibiting greater robustness in practical applications. We believe that
access to the "data generator" can deepen the model’s memory of editing samples.

B.7 Parameter Efficiency

The key to lifelong model editing is maintaining con-
stant or slowly increasing computational costs as the num-
ber of edits expands. Here, we provide a quantitative
analysis using LLaMA-2-7B as an example. Suppose we
select model.layers[27].mlp.down_proj.weight as
side memory. In that case, the theoretically added parame-
ters are 11008 × 4096 × 4 = 0.18 GB, which accounts for
0.64% of the original LLaMA’s 7B × 4 = 28 GB (ignoring the VRAM required for input activations).
As shown in Figure 13, in practice, WISE-Merge increases VRAM by 4% compared to the original
LLaMA and remains constant over time. WISE-Retrieve, instead of merging, uses retrieval routing,
meaning the computational cost increases over time, but this increase is gradual and can easily
handle thousands or tens of thousands of inputs. Additionally, if we partially merge side MLPs
(combining WISE-Retrieve and WISE-Merge), we can further reduce the computational demands of
WISE-Retrieve.

C Proof of Theorem 2.1

v′ and Wj

Theorem C.1 Subspace Overlap. Generate k memory subspaces Wi
v′, i ∈ [k] by random mask
with 1’s ratio ρ, so each memory has ρ · |Wv′| active trained parameters. For any two subspaces
Wi
v′ i ̸= j; i, j ∈ [k], there are ρ2 · |Wv′| active parameters that are overlapped. For all k
subspaces, there are ρk · |Wv′| overlapped active parameters.
Proof: We aim to prove the Subspace Overlap theorem by induction.
Let Wi
where i ∈ [k]. Each memory subspace Wi
We start by considering the case of two memory subspaces, Wi
v′, where i ̸= j and i, j ∈ [k].
Let P (parameter sampled) = ρ be the probability that a parameter is sampled in one mask generation
event.

v′ contains ρ · |Wv′| active trained parameters.
v′ and Wj

v′ represent the i-th memory subspace generated by a random mask with a sparsity ratio of ρ,

1. For a single mask generation, the probability that a specific parameter is sampled is ρ. We

denote this probability as P (sampled) = ρ.

2. Considering two independent mask generation events, the probability that the same parameter
is sampled in both masks is the product of their individual probabilities, i.e., ρ2. This is
derived from the independence of the events. Mathematically:

P (sampled in both masks) = P (sampled) × P (sampled) = ρ × ρ = ρ2.

3. Extending this logic, for k independent mask generation events, the probability that a specific

parameter is sampled in all k masks is ρk. Mathematically:

P (sampled in all k masks) = P (sampled) × P (sampled) × · · · × P (sampled)
(cid:125)

(cid:124)

(cid:123)(cid:122)

= ρk.

Now, let’s calculate the number of parameters overlapped in two random masks:
The total number of parameters in Wv′ is |Wv′|.
Thus, the number of parameters overlapped in two random masks, Wi
Extending this to k random masks, the number of parameters overlapped in all k masks is ρk · |Wv′|.
This concludes the proof.

v′, is ρ2 · |Wv′|.

Memory and Knowledge Injection of LLMs The memories of LLMs can be divided into long-
term (episodic) memory and working memory (short-term) [24, 25, 27]. Long-term memory refers to
the knowledge stored in the model’s parameters, which can be updated by (re)pretraining [53], finetun-
ing [59], and model editing [14]. Working memory is stored in sustained activations/representations
of neurons, which will be awakened during inference time [24]. In-context learning (ICL) is a kind
of working memory [60], also along with retrieval-based editing methods like GRACE [10]. How
to reinforce memory and inject/update knowledge for LLMs is a fundamental question [28, 61, 62].
ICL or finetuning? Different works show different conclusions. In [62], the authors find that few-shot
finetuning is more generalizable than ICL, especially for out-of-distribution data. In [61], the authors
contrast finetuning with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in terms of knowledge injection and
find that RAG is better in most cases, and combining both will produce the best results. However,
finetuning and pretraining are computation-expensive [13, 10] and usually suffer from catastrophic
forgetting [63] and overfitting [64]. For ICL and RAG, the working memory is sometimes not
controllable, the model may not follow the information of the contexts [24], and the context window
is limited [91, 92], and there are works addressing these issues by training controllable ICL [24],
long-context [91, 92], and recurrent memory architecture design [28]. SPALM is proposed to add
language models with storage modules that resemble both working and long-term memories [27].

Model Editing of LLMs Model editing can be summarized as the following lines of research.
Constrained finetuning: Preliminary model editing uses constrained finetuning to update parameters
based on new examples [93, 94]. Locate-and-edit: ROME [18] locates the factual associations in
autoregressive LLMs and conducts accurate and efficient edits by taking MLPs as key-value memories.
Then, MEMIT [19] extends ROME from single-editing to mass-editing. COMEBA-HK [95] identifies
the Local Editing Scope and extends MEMIT for sequential editing. In addition, T-Patcher [11]
targets the last feed-forward layer of LLMs, adding an additional neuron for each edit. Meta
learning: Recent meta-learning methods use hypernetworks for aiding editing. MEND [31] learns a
hypernetwork that can decouple the finetuning gradients into the gradient updates that generalize the
edits and won’t damage the performances on unrelated inputs. To remedy the cancellation effect of
MEND, MALMEN [15] uses hypernetwork to produce the weight shifts of editing and formulates the
weight shift aggregation as the least square problem. Retrieval-based methods: Instead of directly
editing the model parameters, retrieval-based methods aim to improve the working memory of LLMs
to enable model editing. IKE [96] uses context-edit facts to guide the model when generating edited
facts. DeCK [97] employs contrasting knowledge decoding, which enhances the confidence of
in-context-based editors in the edited facts. SERAC [32] (a modified version dubbed as DEFER [10])
records edit items in a file and trains additional scope classifier and counterfactual model to detect,
retrieve, and generate the edit-related results. Though the editing retriever and generator are neural
networks, they are too small to have the power of LLMs. GRACE [10] adopts a discrete codebook
of edits for retrieving and replacing the edits’ layer representations during inference. From single
editing [18] to mass editing [15, 19], and from static editing to sequential [11] (continual) or lifelong
editing [10], model editing is developing to meet more realistic demands.

Continual Learning Continual learning [98, 99] tackles the catastrophic forgetting problem in
deep learning models with new knowledge [100], and recent research has focused on various methods
in this area. One such method is continual finetuning, where LLMs are refined over time with the
arrival of new instances. For instance, a comprehensive study by [101] explores continual finetuning
extensively. However, it has been observed that regularizing finetuning with continual learning
techniques such as Elastic Weight Consolidation [20], Experience Replay [102], and Maximally
Interfered Replay [103] can lead to a rapid decay in performance on previous tasks, although it aids
in retaining some memory of past inputs. This suggests that editing, as opposed to vanilla continual
finetuning, presents unique challenges, especially considering that edits are unlikely to be evenly
distributed [104]. One promising direction within the realm of continual learning is the adoption
of key-value methods, inspired by advancements in computer vision [105, 106]. Recent studies
have showcased the effectiveness of continual prompt-learning for NLP [107, 108], particularly in
applications like text retrieval [109]. Notably, discrete key-value methods have been shown to excel in
handling shifting distributions [110], with some recent efforts extending their application to question
answering [111]. These methods cache values to ensure that inputs remain within the distribution for
downstream encoders, thus facilitating the incorporation of longer-term memory, provided there are
adequate computational resources.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Abstract and Section 1 Introduction

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims

made in the paper.

• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.

• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how

much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.

• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals

are not attained by the paper.

2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Section 5 Limitations

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that

the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.

• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.

• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.

• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.

• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms

and how they scale with dataset size.

• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to

address problems of privacy and fairness.

• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?

Answer: [Yes]

29

Justification: Assumptions in Section 2.3.2 and Proofs in Appendix C
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-

referenced.

• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.

• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented

by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.

• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We report the setup throughout the paper as well as in the Section 3.1 and
Appendix A
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.

• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken

to make their results reproducible or verifiable.

• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.

• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how

to reproduce that algorithm.

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe

the architecture clearly and fully.

(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).

(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

30

Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We use publicly available datasets (Appendix A), Code and Data are also
provided in supplemental material.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/

public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.

• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).

• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.

• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.

• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized

versions (if applicable).

• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the

paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: In Appendix A, we provide detailed descriptions of data splits and the proposed
method’s hyperparameters and baselines’ hyperparameters. Additionally, in Section 3.3, we
discuss how to select them for the proposed method.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail

that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.

• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental

material.

7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The LLMs only have one checkpoint of the corresponding size, e.g.,
LLaMA-2-7B, so we only edit once for each setting. But we test our method and base-
lines under various models, settings, and datasets, therefore, the statistical significance of
the experiments can be verified and supported.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.

• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).

31

• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,

call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)

• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error

of the mean.

• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.

• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).

• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: In Appendix A.3, B.7 and Section 3.3

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,

or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.

• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual

experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.

• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We use publicly standard datasets that do not contain information about
individual people or offensive context to our knowledge. Ethical considerations are discussed
in Section 5.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a

deviation from the Code of Ethics.

• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-

eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: In Section 5

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal

impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.

32

• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.

• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.

• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: [NA]
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.

• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors

should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.

• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Section 3.1 and Appendix A. We use publicly available artifacts.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a

URL.

• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of

service of that source should be provided.

• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.

33

• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of

the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.

• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to

the asset’s creators.

13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: [NA]
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.

• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose

asset is used.

• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either

create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.

14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: [NA]
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with

human subjects.

• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.

• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.

15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human

Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: [NA]
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with

human subjects.

• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.

• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.

• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if

applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
